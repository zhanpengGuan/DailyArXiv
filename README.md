| **[TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series Forecasting Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PVLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[DeepHeteroIoT: Deep Local and Global Learning over Heterogeneous IoT Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19996v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data or readings evince variations in timestamp range, sampling frequency, geographical location, unit of measurement, etc. Such presented sequence data heterogeneity makes it difficult for traditional time series classification algorithms to perform well. Therefore, addressing the heterogeneity challenge demands learning not only the sub-patterns (local features) but also the overall pattern (global feature). To address the challenge of classifying heterogeneous IoT sensor data (e.g., categorizing sensor data types like temperature and humidity), we propose a novel deep learning model that incorporates both Convolutional Neural Network and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit to learn local and global features respectively, in an end-to-end manner. Through rigorous experimentation on heterogeneous IoT sensor datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which outperforms recent state-of-the-art classification methods as well as several machine learning and deep learning baselines. In particular, the model achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.37% in Accuracy and 2.85% in F1-Score across datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication and Presented in EAI MobiQuitous 2023 - 20th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services</p></details> |
| **[MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19888v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Measuring Online Emotional Reactions to Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10245v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich and dynamic information environment of social media provides researchers, policy makers, and entrepreneurs with opportunities to learn about social phenomena in a timely manner. However, using this data to understand social behavior is difficult due heterogeneity of topics and events discussed in the highly dynamic online information environment. To address these challenges, we present a method for systematically detecting and measuring emotional reactions to offline events using change point detection on the time series of collective affect, and further explaining these reactions using a transformer-based topic model. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a corpus of tweets from a large US metropolitan area between January and August, 2020, covering a period of great social change. We demonstrate that our method is able to disaggregate topics to measure population's emotional and moral reactions. This capability allows for better monitoring of population's reactions during crises using online data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining. 2023</p></details> |
| **[Feature-Based Echo-State Networks: A Step Towards Interpretability and Minimalism in Reservoir Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19806v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel and interpretable recurrent neural-network structure using the echo-state network (ESN) paradigm for time-series prediction. While the traditional ESNs perform well for dynamical systems prediction, it needs a large dynamic reservoir with increased computational complexity. It also lacks interpretability to discern contributions from different input combinations to the output. Here, a systematic reservoir architecture is developed using smaller parallel reservoirs driven by different input combinations, known as features, and then they are nonlinearly combined to produce the output. The resultant feature-based ESN (Feat-ESN) outperforms the traditional single-reservoir ESN with less reservoir nodes. The predictive capability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated on three systems: two synthetic datasets from chaotic dynamical systems and a set of real-time traffic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 12 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2304.00198, arXiv:2211.05992</p></details> |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Swarm Characteristics Classification Using Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19572v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the characteristics of swarming autonomous agents is critical for defense and security applications. This article presents a study on using supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key attributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts. Specifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes - communication and proportional navigation - which combine to define four mutually exclusive swarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm classification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing intelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through simulated swarm-vs-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms of observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm size. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using short observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful degradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent scalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents. These capabilities are promising for real-time decision-making support in defense scenarios by rapidly inferring insights about swarm behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning Patterns in Financial Time-Series for Trend-Following Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10500v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models for systematic trading strategies do not adapt quickly when financial market conditions rapidly change, as was seen in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing many forecasting models to take loss-making positions. To deal with such situations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that can quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. We leverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot learning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network -- X-Trend -- which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series regimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to make forecasts, then subsequently takes positions for a new distinct target regime. By quickly adapting to new financial regimes, X-Trend increases Sharpe ratio by 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-series Momentum strategy during the turbulent market period from 2018 to 2023. Our strategy recovers twice as quickly from the COVID-19 drawdown compared to the neural-forecaster. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseen financial assets obtaining a 5-fold Sharpe ratio increase versus a neural time-series trend forecaster over the same period. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts and patterns in the context set.</p></details> | minor edits |
| **[Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Greedy and Simulated Annealing Ideas for Vascular Robot Ordering Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19484v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a comprehensive approach for optimizing the acquisition, utilization, and maintenance of ABLVR vascular robots in healthcare settings. Medical robotics, particularly in vascular treatments, necessitates precise resource allocation and optimization due to the complex nature of robot and operator maintenance. Traditional heuristic methods, though intuitive, often fail to achieve global optimization. To address these challenges, this research introduces a novel strategy, combining mathematical modeling, a hybrid genetic algorithm, and ARIMA time series forecasting. Considering the dynamic healthcare environment, our approach includes a robust resource allocation model for robotic vessels and operators. We incorporate the unique requirements of the adaptive learning process for operators and the maintenance needs of robotic components. The hybrid genetic algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and greedy approaches, efficiently solves the optimization problem. Additionally, ARIMA time series forecasting predicts the demand for vascular robots, further enhancing the adaptability of our strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of optimization, transparency, and convergence speed from other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Exploiting Individual Graph Structures to Enhance Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19442v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving field of psychopathology, the accurate assessment and forecasting of data derived from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is crucial. EMA offers contextually-rich psychopathological measurements over time, that practically lead to Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. Thus, many challenges arise in analysis from the temporal complexities inherent in emotional, behavioral, and contextual EMA data as well as their inter-dependencies. To address both of these aspects, this research investigates the performance of Recurrent and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Overall, GNNs, by incorporating additional information from graphs reflecting the inner relationships between the variables, notably enhance the results by decreasing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 0.84 compared to the baseline LSTM model at 1.02. Therefore, the effect of constructing graphs with different characteristics on GNN performance is also explored. Additionally, GNN-learned graphs, which are dynamically refined during the training process, were evaluated. Using such graphs showed a similarly good performance. Thus, graph learning proved also promising for other GNN methods, potentially refining the pre-defined graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Constants of Motion for Conserved and Non-conserved Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19418v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper begins with a dynamical model that was obtained by applying a machine learning technique (FJet) to time-series data; this dynamical model is then analyzed with Lie symmetry techniques to obtain constants of motion. This analysis is performed on both the conserved and non-conserved cases of the 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators. For the 1D oscillator, constants are found in the cases where the system is underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. The novel existence of such a constant for a non-conserved model is interpreted as a manifestation of the conservation of energy of the {\em total} system (i.e., oscillator plus dissipative environment). For the 2D oscillator, constants are found for the isotropic and anisotropic cases, including when the frequencies are incommensurate; it is also generalized to arbitrary dimensions. In addition, a constant is identified which generalizes angular momentum for all ratios of the frequencies. The approach presented here can produce {\em multiple} constants of motion from a {\em single}, generic data set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Enhancing Time Series Contrastive Learning: A Dynamic Bad Pair Mining Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03357v3)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not all positive pairs are beneficial to time series contrastive learning. In this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that can impair the quality of time series representation learned through contrastive learning: the noisy positive pair and the faulty positive pair. We observe that, with the presence of noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise (Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model wastes considerable amount of effort aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining (DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs in time series contrastive learning. Specifically, DBPM utilizes a memory module to dynamically track the training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their historical training behaviors. The identified bad pairs are subsequently down-weighted through a transformation module, thereby mitigating their negative impact on the representation learning process. DBPM is a simple algorithm designed as a lightweight plug-in without learnable parameters to enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, real-world time series datasets, we demonstrate DBPM's efficacy in mitigating the adverse effects of bad positive pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera Ready (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=K2c04ulKXn)</p></details> |
| **[A loss discounting framework for model averaging and selection in time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12045v4)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Loss Discounting Framework for model and forecast combination which generalises and combines Bayesian model synthesis and generalized Bayes methodologies. We use a loss function to score the performance of different models and introduce a multilevel discounting scheme which allows a flexible specification of the dynamics of the model weights. This novel and simple model combination approach can be easily applied to large scale model averaging/selection, can handle unusual features such as sudden regime changes, and can be tailored to different forecasting problems. We compare our method to both established methodologies and state of the art methods for a number of macroeconomic forecasting examples. We find that the proposed method offers an attractive, computationally efficient alternative to the benchmark methodologies and often outperforms more complex techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computationally and Memory-Efficient Robust Predictive Analytics Using Big Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19721v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current data-intensive era, big data has become a significant asset for Artificial Intelligence (AI), serving as a foundation for developing data-driven models and providing insight into various unknown fields. This study navigates through the challenges of data uncertainties, storage limitations, and predictive data-driven modeling using big data. We utilize Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) for effective noise reduction and outlier elimination, and Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) for efficient data compression and storage. The proposed OSP technique enables data compression without substantial information loss while simultaneously reducing storage needs. While RPCA offers an enhanced alternative to traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high-dimensional data management, the scope of this work extends its utilization, focusing on robust, data-driven modeling applicable to huge data sets in real-time. For that purpose, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, are applied to model and predict data based on a low-dimensional subset obtained from OSP, leading to a crucial acceleration of the training phase. LSTMs are feasible for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data, making them particularly suited for predicting the future states of physical systems on historical data. All the presented algorithms are not only theorized but also simulated and validated using real thermal imaging data mapping a ship's engine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visualizing High-Dimensional Temporal Data Using Direction-Aware t-SNE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19040v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world data sets contain a temporal component or involve transitions from state to state. For exploratory data analysis, we can represent these high-dimensional data sets in two-dimensional maps, using embeddings of the data objects under exploration and representing their temporal relationships with directed edges. Most existing dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE and UMAP, do not take into account the temporal or relational nature of the data when constructing the embeddings, resulting in temporally cluttered visualizations that obscure potentially interesting patterns. To address this problem, we propose two complementary, direction-aware loss terms in the optimization function of t-SNE that emphasize the temporal aspects of the data, guiding the optimization and the resulting embedding to reveal temporal patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. The Directional Coherence Loss (DCL) encourages nearby arrows connecting two adjacent time series points to point in the same direction, while the Edge Length Loss (ELL) penalizes arrows - which effectively represent time gaps in the visualized embedding - based on their length. Both loss terms are differentiable and can be easily incorporated into existing dimensionality reduction techniques. By promoting local directionality of the directed edges, our procedure produces more temporally meaningful and less cluttered visualizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a toy dataset and two real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Matrix Factorization: When Features Differ by Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17744v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In myriad statistical applications, data are collected from related but heterogeneous sources. These sources share some commonalities while containing idiosyncratic characteristics. One of the most fundamental challenges in such scenarios is to recover the shared and source-specific factors. Despite the existence of a few heuristic approaches, a generic algorithm with theoretical guarantees has yet to be established. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a method called Heterogeneous Matrix Factorization to separate the shared and unique factors for a class of problems. HMF maintains the orthogonality between the shared and unique factors by leveraging an invariance property in the objective. The algorithm is easy to implement and intrinsically distributed. On the theoretic side, we show that for the square error loss, HMF will converge into the optimal solutions, which are close to the ground truth. HMF can be integrated auto-encoders to learn nonlinear feature mappings. Through a variety of case studies, we showcase HMF's benefits and applicability in video segmentation, time-series feature extraction, and recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Two different approaches were compared. One based on the direct classification of time series data, using a custom implementation of the InceptionTime network. For the other approach, we generated 2D images of the wavelet transformation of the signals, which were subsequently classified using a ResNet implementation. Choosing appropriate hyperparameter settings, both achieve a classification accuracy of above 90 %, with the direct approach reaching 95.2 %.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Generative Pre-Training of Time-Series Data for Unsupervised Fault Detection in Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11427v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TRACE-GPT, which stands for Time-seRies Anomaly-detection with Convolutional Embedding and Generative Pre-trained Transformers. TRACE-GPT is designed to pre-train univariate time-series sensor data and detect faults on unlabeled datasets in semiconductor manufacturing. In semiconductor industry, classifying abnormal time-series sensor data from normal data is important because it is directly related to wafer defect. However, small, unlabeled, and even mixed training data without enough anomalies make classification tasks difficult. In this research, we capture features of time-series data with temporal convolutional embedding and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to classify abnormal sequences from normal sequences using cross entropy loss. We prove that our model shows better performance than previous unsupervised models with both an open dataset, the University of California Riverside (UCR) time-series classification archive, and the process log of our Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment. Our model has the highest F1 score at Equal Error Rate (EER) across all datasets and is only 0.026 below the supervised state-of-the-art baseline on the open dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Language Beat Numerical Regression? Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

| **[IIP-Mixer:Intra-Inter Patch Mixing Architecture for Battery Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18379v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for maintaining the safe and stable operation of rechargeable battery management systems. However, this task is often challenging due to the complex temporal dynamics involved. Recently, attention-based networks, such as Transformers and Informer, have been the popular architecture in time series forecasting. Despite their effectiveness, these models with abundant parameters necessitate substantial training time to unravel temporal patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a simple MLP-Mixer-based architecture named 'Intra-Inter Patch Mixer' (IIP-Mixer), which is an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), extracting information by mixing operations along both intra-patch and inter-patch dimensions for battery RUL prediction. The proposed IIP-Mixer comprises parallel dual-head mixer layers: the intra-patch mixing MLP, capturing local temporal patterns in the short-term period, and the inter-patch mixing MLP, capturing global temporal patterns in the long-term period. Notably, to address the varying importance of features in RUL prediction, we introduce a weighted loss function in the MLP-Mixer-based architecture, marking the first time such an approach has been employed. Our experiments demonstrate that IIP-Mixer achieves competitive performance in battery RUL prediction, outperforming other popular time-series frameworks</p></details> |  |

In contrast to popular Poisson-INGARCH models, but in line with classical GARCH models, we propose to pick the conditional distributions from nearly scale invariant families where the mean absolute value and the standard deviation are of the same order of magnitude. As an important prerequisite for applications in statistics, we prove absolute regularity of the count process with exponentially decaying coefficients.</p></details> |  |

| **[AE SemRL: Learning Semantic Association Rules with Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18133v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of learning associations among data features in the form of logical rules. Mining association rules from high-dimensional numerical data, for example, time series data from a large number of sensors in a smart environment, is a computationally intensive task. In this study, we propose an Autoencoder-based approach to learn and extract association rules from time series data (AE SemRL). Moreover, we argue that in the presence of semantic information related to time series data sources, semantics can facilitate learning generalizable and explainable association rules. Despite enriching time series data with additional semantic features, AE SemRL makes learning association rules from high-dimensional data feasible. Our experiments show that semantic association rules can be extracted from a latent representation created by an Autoencoder and this method has in the order of hundreds of times faster execution time than state-of-the-art ARM approaches in many scenarios. We believe that this study advances a new way of extracting associations from representations and has the potential to inspire more research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-PAD: Deep-Shallow Multi-Frequency Patterns Disentangling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17814v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series forecasting, effectively disentangling intricate temporal patterns is crucial. While recent works endeavor to combine decomposition techniques with deep learning, multiple frequencies may still be mixed in the decomposed components, e.g., trend and seasonal. Furthermore, frequency domain analysis methods, e.g., Fourier and wavelet transforms, have limitations in resolution in the time domain and adaptability. In this paper, we propose D-PAD, a deep-shallow multi-frequency patterns disentangling neural network for time series forecasting. Specifically, a multi-component decomposing (MCD) block is introduced to decompose the series into components with different frequency ranges, corresponding to the "shallow" aspect. A decomposition-reconstruction-decomposition (D-R-D) module is proposed to progressively extract the information of frequencies mixed in the components, corresponding to the "deep" aspect. After that, an interaction and fusion (IF) module is used to further analyze the components. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that D-PAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.48% and 7.15% in MSE and MAE, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis on reservoir activation with the nonlinearity harnessed from solution-processed MoS2 devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17676v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing is a recurrent neural network that has been applied across various domains in machine learning. The implementation of reservoir computing, however, often demands heavy computations for activating the reservoir. Configuring physical reservoir networks and harnessing the nonlinearity from the underlying devices for activation is an emergent solution to address the computational challenge. Herein, we analyze the feasibility of employing the nonlinearity from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) devices for reservoir activation. The devices, fabricated using liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2, exhibit a high-order nonlinearity achieved by Stark modulation of the MoS2 material. We demonstrate that this nonlinearity can be fitted and employed as the activation function to facilitate reservoir computing implementation. Notably, owing to the high-order nonlinearity, the network exhibits long-term synchronization and robust generalization abilities for approximating complex dynamical systems. Given the remarkable reservoir activation capability, coupled with the scalability of the device fabrication, our findings open the possibility for the physical realization of lightweight, efficient reservoir computing for, for instance, signal classification, motion tracking, and pattern recognition of complex time series as well as secure cryptography. As an example, we show the network can be appointed to generate chaotic random numbers for secure data encryption.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is a challenging task due to the algorithm`s complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art of deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling for Time-Dependent Inverse Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00641v3)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel hierarchical Bayesian model specifically designed to address challenges in Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) for time-dependent problems in nuclear Thermal Hydraulics (TH) systems. The unique characteristics of time-dependent data, such as high dimensionality and correlation in model outputs requires special attention in the IUQ process. By integrating Gaussian Processes (GP) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we efficiently construct surrogate models that effectively handle the complexity of dynamic TH systems. Additionally, we incorporate Neural Network (NN) models for time series regression, enhancing the computational accuracy and facilitating derivative calculations for efficient posterior sampling using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method - No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this hierarchical Bayesian approach using the transient experiments in the PSBT benchmark. Our results show improved estimates of Physical Model Parameters' posterior distributions and a reduced tendency for over-fitting, compared to conventional single-level Bayesian models. This approach offers a promising framework for extending IUQ to more complex, time-dependent problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation of Long-Range Dependent Models with Missing Data: to Impute or not to Impute?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04754v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the most important models for long-range dependent time series is the class of ARFIMA$(p,d,q)$ (Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average) models. Estimating the long-range dependence parameter $d$ in ARFIMA models is a well-studied problem, but the literature regarding the estimation of $d$ in the presence of missing data is very sparse. There are two basic approaches to dealing with the problem: missing data can be imputed using some plausible method, and then the estimation can proceed as if no data were missing, or we can use a specially tailored methodology to estimate $d$ in the presence of missing data. In this work, we review some of the methods available for both approaches and compare them through a Monte Carlo simulation study. We present a comparison among 35 different setups to estimate $d$, under tenths of different scenarios, considering percentages of missing data ranging from as few as 10\% up to 70\% and several levels of dependence.</p></details> |  |

Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series.

| **[Time Series Compression using Quaternion Valued Neural Networks and Quaternion Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11722v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel quaternionic time-series compression methodology where we divide a long time-series into segments of data, extract the min, max, mean and standard deviation of these chunks as representative features and encapsulate them in a quaternion, yielding a quaternion valued time-series. This time-series is processed using quaternion valued neural network layers, where we aim to preserve the relation between these features through the usage of the Hamilton product. To train this quaternion neural network, we derive quaternion backpropagation employing the GHR calculus, which is required for a valid product and chain rule in quaternion space. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between the derived update rules and automatic differentiation. We apply our proposed compression method on the Tennessee Eastman Dataset, where we perform fault classification using the compressed data in two settings: a fully supervised one and in a semi supervised, contrastive learning setting. Both times, we were able to outperform real valued counterparts as well as two baseline models: one with the uncompressed time-series as the input and the other with a regular downsampling using the mean. Further, we could improve the classification benchmark set by SimCLR-TS from 81.43% to 83.90%.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time series forecasting, even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. A number of variations to the linear model have been proposed, often including some form of feature normalisation that improves model generalisation. In this paper we analyse the sets of functions expressible using these linear model architectures. In so doing we show that several popular variants of linear models for time series forecasting are equivalent and functionally indistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. We characterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate that each model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over a suitably augmented feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions when using a mean-squared loss function. We provide experimental evidence that the models under inspection learn nearly identical solutions, and finally demonstrate that the simpler closed form solutions are superior forecasters across 72% of test settings.</p></details> |  |

River flow data typically have features of heavy tails and non-linearity, as large precipitation events cause sudden spikes in the data that then exponentially decay. Therefore, stationary Max-ARMA models are a suitable candidate for capturing the unique temporal dependence structure exhibited by river flows. This paper contributes to advancing our understanding of the extremal properties of stationary Max-ARMA processes. We detail the first approach for deriving the extremal index, the lagged asymptotic dependence coefficient, and an efficient simulation for a general Max-ARMA process. We use the extremal properties, coupled with the belief that Max-ARMA processes provide only an approximation to extreme river flow, to fit such a model which can broadly capture river flow behaviour over a high threshold. We make our inference under a reparametrisation which gives a simpler parameter space that excludes cases where any parameter is non-identifiable. We illustrate results for river flow data from the UK River Thames.</p></details> |  |
| **[In the Search for Optimal Multi-view Learning Models for Crop Classification with Global Remote Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16582v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination, including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or related tasks through a MVL approach.</p></details> | submitted to journal |

Due to the significant disparity between medical and natural images, the application of typical SSL is not straightforward in medical imaging. Additionally, those pretext tasks often lack context, which is critical for computer-aided clinical decision support. In this paper, we developed a longitudinal masked auto-encoder (MAE) based on the well-known Transformer-based MAE. In particular, we explored the importance of time-aware position embedding as well as disease progression-aware masking. Taking into account the time between examinations instead of just scheduling them offers the benefit of capturing temporal changes and trends. The masking strategy, for its part, evolves during follow-up to better capture pathological changes, ensuring a more accurate assessment of disease progression. Using OPHDIAT, a large follow-up screening dataset targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR), we evaluated the pre-trained weights on a longitudinal task, which is to predict the severity label of the next visit within 3 years based on the past time series examinations. Our results demonstrated the relevancy of both time-aware position embedding and masking strategies based on disease progression knowledge. Compared to popular baseline models and standard longitudinal Transformers, these simple yet effective extensions significantly enhance the predictive ability of deep classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An early warning indicator trained on stochastic disease-spreading models with different noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16233v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The timely detection of disease outbreaks through reliable early warning signals (EWSs) is indispensable for effective public health mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, the intricate dynamics of real-world disease spread, often influenced by diverse sources of noise and limited data in the early stages of outbreaks, pose a significant challenge in developing reliable EWSs, as the performance of existing indicators varies with extrinsic and intrinsic noises. Here, we address the challenge of modeling disease when the measurements are corrupted by additive white noise, multiplicative environmental noise, and demographic noise into a standard epidemic mathematical model. To navigate the complexities introduced by these noise sources, we employ a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in infectious disease outbreak by training on noise-induced disease-spreading models. The indicator's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world COVID-19 cases in Edmonton and simulated time series derived from diverse disease spread models affected by noise. Notably, the indicator captures an impending transition in a time series of disease outbreaks and outperforms existing indicators. This study contributes to advancing early warning capabilities by addressing the intricate dynamics inherent in real-world disease spread, presenting a promising avenue for enhancing public health preparedness and response efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Masked Model is All You Need for Sensor Fault Detection, Isolation and Accommodation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16153v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable sensor measurements are critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of complex engineering systems such as wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (FDIA) using masked models and self-supervised learning. Our proposed approach is a general time series modeling approach that can be applied to any neural network (NN) model capable of sequence modeling, and captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among different sensors. During training, the proposed masked approach creates a random mask, which acts like a fault, for one or more sensors, making the training and inference task unified: finding the faulty sensors and correcting them. We validate our proposed technique on both a public dataset and a real-world dataset from GE offshore wind turbines, and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting, diagnosing and correcting sensor faults. The masked model not only simplifies the overall FDIA pipeline, but also outperforms existing approaches. Our proposed technique has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor measurements in complex engineering systems in real-time, and could be applied to other types of sensors and engineering systems in the future. We believe that our proposed framework can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective FDIA techniques for a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16144v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v3)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

They often require special consideration of decomposition and multi-scale modeling to analyze. Existing deep learning methods on this best fit to univariate time series only, and have not sufficiently considered sub-series modeling and decomposition completeness. To address these challenges, we propose MSD-Mixer, a Multi-Scale Decomposition MLP-Mixer, which learns to explicitly decompose and represent the input time series in its different layers. To handle the multi-scale temporal patterns and multivariate dependencies, we propose a novel temporal patching approach to model the time series as multi-scale patches, and employ MLPs to capture intra- and inter-patch variations and channel-wise correlations. In addition, we propose a novel loss function to constrain both the mean and the autocorrelation of the decomposition residual for better decomposition completeness. Through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets for five common time series analysis tasks, we demonstrate that MSD-Mixer consistently and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with better efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for VLDB 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

However, since this RNN is optimized to super-resolve short videos, VSR of long videos is degraded due to the domain gap. Our preliminary experiments reveal that such degradation changes depending on the video properties, such as the video length and dynamics. To avoid this degradation, this paper proposes the training strategy of RNN for VSR that can work efficiently and stably independently of the video length and dynamics. The proposed training strategy stabilizes VSR by training a VSR network with various RNN hidden states changed depending on the video properties. Since computing such a variety of hidden states is time-consuming, this computational cost is reduced by reusing the hidden states for efficient training. In addition, training stability is further improved with frame-number conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performed better than base methods in videos with various lengths and dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2024 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks)</p></details> |

However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

Recent architectures learn complex temporal patterns by segmenting a time-series into patches and using the patches as tokens. The patch size controls the ability of transformers to learn the temporal patterns at different frequencies: shorter patches are effective for learning localized, high-frequency patterns, whereas mining long-term seasonalities and trends requires longer patches. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer (MTST), which consists of a multi-branch architecture for simultaneous modeling of diverse temporal patterns at different resolutions. In contrast to many existing time-series transformers, we employ relative positional encoding, which is better suited for extracting periodic components at different scales. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MTST in comparison to state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |

During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes: M1, which can worsen brain injury; or M2, which can aid in long-term recovery. In this study, we contribute a summary of experimental data on microglial cell counts in the penumbra following ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and compile available data sets into a single set suitable for time series analysis. Further, we formulate a mathematical model of microglial cells in the penumbra during ischemic stroke due to MCAO. Through use of global sensitivity analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based parameter estimation, we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the number of M1 and M2 cells in the penumbra and fit identifiable parameters to the compiled experimental data set. We utilize results from MCMC parameter estimation to ascertain uncertainty bounds and forward predictions for the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells over time. Results demonstrate the significance of parameters related to M1 and M2 activation on the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells. Simulations further suggest that potential outliers in the observed data may be omitted and forecast predictions suggest a lingering inflammatory response.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning to Embed Time Series Patches Independently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16427v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Improved Long Short-Term Memory-based Wastewater Treatment Simulators for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15091v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) showed outstanding results in the fields of Robotics and Games, it is still challenging to implement it in the optimization of industrial processes like wastewater treatment. One of the challenges is the lack of a simulation environment that will represent the actual plant as accurately as possible to train DRL policies. Stochasticity and non-linearity of wastewater treatment data lead to unstable and incorrect predictions of models over long time horizons. One possible reason for the models' incorrect simulation behavior can be related to the issue of compounding error, which is the accumulation of errors throughout the simulation. The compounding error occurs because the model utilizes its predictions as inputs at each time step. The error between the actual data and the prediction accumulates as the simulation continues. We implemented two methods to improve the trained models for wastewater treatment data, which resulted in more accurate simulators: 1- Using the model's prediction data as input in the training step as a tool of correction, and 2- Change in the loss function to consider the long-term predicted shape (dynamics). The experimental results showed that implementing these methods can improve the behavior of simulators in terms of Dynamic Time Warping throughout a year up to 98% compared to the base model. These improvements demonstrate significant promise in creating simulators for biological processes that do not need pre-existing knowledge of the process but instead depend exclusively on time series data obtained from the system.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of these models are viewed as black-box, requiring a significant amount of data for development. Consequently, in situations with limited data, constructing appropriate models becomes challenging due to the lack of transparency and scarcity of data. To tackle these challenges, this study suggests the implementation of a grey-informed neural network (GINN). The GINN ensures that the output of the neural network follows the differential equation model of the grey system, improving interpretability. Moreover, incorporating prior knowledge from grey system theory enables traditional neural networks to effectively handle small data samples. Our proposed model has been observed to uncover underlying patterns in the real world and produce reliable forecasts based on empirical data.</p></details> |  |

While numerous algorithms have been developed, most of them focus on model design and updating. In practice, many of these methods struggle with continuous performance regression in the face of accumulated concept drifts over time. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach, Concept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{D}etection an\textbf{D} \textbf{A}daptation (D3A), that first detects drifting conception and then aggressively adapts the current model to the drifted concepts after the detection for rapid adaption. To best harness the utility of historical data for model adaptation, we propose a data augmentation strategy introducing Gaussian noise into existing training instances. It helps mitigate the data distribution gap, a critical factor contributing to train-test performance inconsistency. The significance of our data augmentation process is verified by our theoretical analysis. Our empirical studies across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D3A in improving model adaptation capability. Notably, compared to a simple Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline, D3A reduces the average Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $43.9\%$. For the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the MSE is reduced by $33.3\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.12659</p></details> |
| **[Local and Global Trend Bayesian Exponential Smoothing Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13950v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a family of seasonal and non-seasonal time series models that can be viewed as generalisations of additive and multiplicative exponential smoothing models, to model series that grow faster than linear but slower than exponential. Their development is motivated by fast-growing, volatile time series. In particular, our models have a global trend that can smoothly change from additive to multiplicative, and is combined with a linear local trend. Seasonality when used is multiplicative in our models, and the error is always additive but is heteroscedastic and can grow through a parameter sigma. We leverage state-of-the-art Bayesian fitting techniques to accurately fit these models that are more complex and flexible than standard exponential smoothing models. When applied to the M3 competition data set, our models outperform the best algorithms in the competition as well as other benchmarks, thus achieving to the best of our knowledge the best results of per-series univariate methods on this dataset in the literature. An open-source software package of our method is available.</p></details> |  |

Consistent clustering algorithms, like DBSCAN, allow us to make sense of the data in a useful way. However, while there is a large literature on the consistency of various clustering algorithms for high-dimensional static clustering, the literature on multivariate time series clustering still largely relies on heuristics or restrictive assumptions. The aim of this paper is to prove a notion of consistency of DBSCAN for the task of clustering multivariate time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Physical Information Consistency of Channel Data Augmentation for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14547v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of data augmentation for deep learning (DL) methods plays an important role in achieving state-of-the-art results in supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised image classification. In particular, channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium</p></details> |

Existing methods predict oncoming catastrophes in individual systems but are primarily time-series-based and struggle both to categorize qualitative dynamical regimes across diverse systems and to generalize to real data. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing bifurcation boundaries based on the extraction of topologically invariant features. We focus on the paradigmatic case of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of applications. Our convolutional attention method is trained with data augmentations that encourage the learning of topological invariants which can be used to detect bifurcation boundaries in unseen systems and to design models of biological systems like oscillatory gene regulatory networks. We further demonstrate our method's use in analyzing real data by recovering distinct proliferation and differentiation dynamics along pancreatic endocrinogenesis trajectory in gene expression space based on single-cell data. Our method provides valuable insights into the qualitative, long-term behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems, and can detect bifurcations or catastrophic transitions in large-scale physical and biological systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the annual phenology curve from multi-annual observations of time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite images. We fitted the classical harmonic regression model to annual-based time series in order to construe the original data set as realizations of a functional process. Hierarchical clustering was applied to define a nearly homogeneous group of annual (smoothed) time series from which a representative and idealized phenology curve was estimated at the pixel level. This curve resulted from fitting a mixed model, based on functional principal components, to the homogeneous group of time series. Leveraging the idealized phenology curve, we employed standard calculus criteria to estimate the following phenological parameters (stationary events): green up, start of season, maturity, senescence, end of season and dormancy. By applying the proposed methodology to four different data cubes (time series from 2000 to 2023 of a popular satellite-derived vegetation index) recorded across grasslands, forests, and annual rainfed agricultural zones of a Flora and Fauna Protected Area in northern Mexico, we verified that our approach characterizes properly the phenological cycle in vegetation with nearly periodic dynamics, such as grasslands and agricultural areas. The R package sephora was used for all computations in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Trending data-driven approaches efficiency, for image inpainting, often requires extensive data preprocessing. In this sense, there is still a need for model-driven approaches in case of application constrained with data availability and quality, especially for those related for time series forecasting using image inpainting techniques. This paper proposes an improved modeldriven approach relying on patch-based techniques. Our approach deviates from the standard Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) similarity measure by introducing a Hybrid Similarity (HySim), which combines both strengths of Chebychev and Minkowski distances. This hybridization enhances patch selection, leading to high-quality inpainting results with reduced mismatch errors. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of our approach against other model-driven techniques, such as diffusion or patch-based approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving visually pleasing restorations.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis. In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either the application or the pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a model-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future research exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGCN: Progressive Graph Convolutional Networks for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08982v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Present works have demonstrated the efficacy of modeling interstock relations for market time-series forecasting and utilized Graph-based learning models for value prediction and portfolio management. Though convincing, these deterministic approaches still fall short of handling uncertainties i.e., due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective deterministic models. Since the probabilistic methods have shown to effectively emulate higher uncertainties for time-series predictions. To this end, we showcase effective utilisation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), to develop an architecture for providing better market predictions conditioned on the historical financial indicators and inter-stock relations. Additionally, we also provide a novel deterministic architecture MaTCHS which uses Masked Relational Transformer(MRT) to exploit inter-stock relations along with historical stock features.

This issue is prevalent in the financial sector, where the future behavior of time series is often intricately linked to information derived from various textual reports and a multitude of economic indicators. In practice, the key challenge lies in constructing a reliable time series forecasting model capable of harnessing data from diverse sources and extracting valuable insights to predict the target time series accurately. In this work, we tackle this challenging problem and introduce a novel multimodal transformer-based model named the \textit{Modality-aware Transformer}. Our model excels in exploring the power of both categorical text and numerical timeseries to forecast the target time series effectively while providing insights through its neural attention mechanism. To achieve this, we develop feature-level attention layers that encourage the model to focus on the most relevant features within each data modality. By incorporating the proposed feature-level attention, we develop a novel Intra-modal multi-head attention (MHA), Inter-modal MHA and Target-modal MHA in a way that both feature and temporal attentions are incorporated in MHAs. This enables the MHAs to generate temporal attentions with consideration of modality and feature importance which leads to more informative embeddings. The proposed modality-aware structure enables the model to effectively exploit information within each modality as well as foster cross-modal understanding. Our extensive experiments on financial datasets demonstrate that Modality-aware Transformer outperforms existing methods, offering a novel and practical solution to the complex challenges of multi-modal financial time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

| **[Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and Föllmer Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13724v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems based on generative modeling. Given observations of the system state over time, we formulate the forecasting problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of the future system state given its current state. To this end, we leverage the framework of stochastic interpolants, which facilitates the construction of a generative model between an arbitrary base distribution and the target. We design a fictitious, non-physical stochastic dynamics that takes as initial condition the current system state and produces as output a sample from the target conditional distribution in finite time and without bias. This process therefore maps a point mass centered at the current state onto a probabilistic ensemble of forecasts. We prove that the drift coefficient entering the stochastic differential equation (SDE) achieving this task is non-singular, and that it can be learned efficiently by square loss regression over the time-series data. We show that the drift and the diffusion coefficients of this SDE can be adjusted after training, and that a specific choice that minimizes the impact of the estimation error gives a F\"ollmer process. We highlight the utility of our approach on several complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems, including stochastically forced Navier-Stokes and video prediction on the KTH and CLEVRER datasets.</p></details> |  |

The sample paths are observed with error at possibly random design points. Non-asymptotic concentration bounds of the regularity estimators are derived. As an application, we build nonparametric mean and autocovariance functions estimators that adapt to the regularity and the design, which can be sparse or dense. We also derive the asymptotic normality of the mean estimator, which allows honest inference for irregular mean functions. Simulations and a real data application illustrate the performance of the new estimators.</p></details> |  |

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented tools. In light of these challenges, this study embarks on an exhaustive dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five principal echelons: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. Our taxonomy promises to serve as a robust navigational aid for scholars, offering clarity and direction in method selection. Addressing the conspicuous absence of holistic evaluations for prevalent DA techniques, we executed an all-encompassing empirical assessment, wherein upwards of 15 DA strategies were subjected to scrutiny across 8 UCR time-series datasets, employing ResNet and a multi-faceted evaluation paradigm encompassing Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, yielding a benchmark accuracy of 88.94 +- 11.83%.

CapsNets employ an affine transformation matrix and dynamic routing with coupling coefficients to learn robustly. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of CapsNets in analyzing highly sensitive and noisy time series sensor data. To demonstrate CapsNets robustness, we compare their performance with original CNNs on electrocardiogram data, a medical time series sensor data with complex patterns and noise. Our study provides empirical evidence that CapsNets function as noise stabilizers, as investigated by manual and adversarial attack experiments using the fast gradient sign method and three manual attacks, including offset shifting, gradual drift, and temporal lagging. In summary, CapsNets outperform CNNs in both manual and adversarial attacked data. Our findings suggest that CapsNets can be effectively applied to various sensor systems to improve their resilience to noise attacks. These results have significant implications for designing and implementing robust machine learning models in real world applications. Additionally, this study contributes to the effectiveness of CapsNet models in handling noisy data and highlights their potential for addressing the challenges of noise data in time series analysis.</p></details> | 3 pages, 3 figures |

We implement three machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for this study. The input features are derived from the recurrence quantification of nonlinear time series and characteristic measures of the corresponding recurrence networks. For training and testing we generate synthetic data from standard nonlinear dynamical systems and evaluate the efficiency and performance of the machine learning algorithms in classifying time series into periodic, chaotic, hyper-chaotic, or noisy categories. Additionally, we explore the significance of input features in the classification scheme and find that the features quantifying the density of recurrence points are the most relevant. Furthermore, we illustrate how the trained algorithms can successfully predict the dynamical states of two variable stars, SX Her and AC Her from the data of their light curves.</p></details> |  |

This requires sophisticated and advanced understanding of the whole related network. Indeed, marketing data may exist in different forms such as qualitative and quantitative data. However, in the literature, it is easily noted that large bibliographies may be collected about qualitative studies, while only a few studies adopt a quantitative point of view. This is a major drawback that results in marketing science still focusing on design, although the market is strongly dependent on quantities such as money and time. Indeed, marketing data may form time series such as brand sales in specified periods, brand-related prices over specified periods, market shares, etc. The purpose of the present work is to investigate some marketing models based on time series for various brands. This paper aims to combine the dynamic mode decomposition and wavelet decomposition to study marketing series due to both prices, and volume sales in order to explore the effect of the time scale on the persistence of brand sales in the market and on the forecasting of such persistence, according to the characteristics of the brand and the related market competition or competitors.

Density functions are nonnegative and have a constrained integral and thus do not constitute a linear vector space. We implement a center log-ratio transformation to transform densities into unconstrained functions. These functions exhibit cross-sectionally correlation and temporal dependence. Via a functional analysis of variance decomposition, we decompose the unconstrained functional panel data into a deterministic trend component and a time-varying residual component. To produce forecasts for the time-varying component, a functional time series forecasting method, based on the estimation of the long-range covariance, is implemented. By combining the forecasts of the time-varying residual component with the deterministic trend component, we obtain h-step-ahead forecast curves for multiple populations. Illustrated by age- and sex-specific life-table death counts in the United States, we apply our proposed method to generate forecasts of the life-table death counts for 51 states.</p></details> |  |

However, not only can these language models produce factually inaccurate articles on reputable websites but disreputable news sites can utilize LLMs to mass produce misinformation. To begin to understand this phenomenon, we present one of the first large-scale studies of the prevalence of synthetic articles within online news media. To do this, we train a DeBERTa-based synthetic news detector and classify over 15.46 million articles from 3,074 misinformation and mainstream news websites. We find that between January 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023, the relative number of synthetic news articles increased by 57.3% on mainstream websites while increasing by 474% on misinformation sites. We find that this increase is largely driven by smaller less popular websites. Analyzing the impact of the release of ChatGPT using an interrupted-time-series, we show that while its release resulted in a marked increase in synthetic articles on small sites as well as misinformation news websites, there was not a corresponding increase on large mainstream news websites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICWSM 2024</p></details> |

We establish an equivalence between a perfect measurement and a variant of the information bottleneck.

By organizing the shapelets into groups, we enable the transformation to transition between levels of competition, resulting in methods that more closely resemble distance-based transformations or dictionary-based transformations. We demonstrate, through an extensive empirical investigation, that Castor yields transformations that result in classifiers that are significantly more accurate than several state-of-the-art classifiers.

This goal is challenged by variability along recording sessions (e.g. environment), subjects (e.g. varying neural structures), and sensors (e.g. sensor noise), among others. Recent work has begun to address generalization across sessions and subjects, but few study robustness to sensor failure which is highly prevalent in neuroscience experiments. In order to address these generalizability dimensions we first collect our own electroencephalography dataset with numerous sessions, subjects, and sensors, then study two time series models: EEGNet (Lawhern et al., 2018) and TOTEM (Talukder et al., 2024). EEGNet is a widely used convolutional neural network, while TOTEM is a discrete time series tokenizer and transformer model. We find that TOTEM outperforms or matches EEGNet across all generalizability cases. Finally through analysis of TOTEM's latent codebook we observe that tokenization enables generalization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures, with various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space or neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining their capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature spaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Subsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property and space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning of commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial gap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the space-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME proposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively retain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity, difference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods for KGC re-ranking are mostly built on non-generative language models to obtain the probability of each candidate. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance on several tasks such as information extraction and dialog systems. Leveraging them for KGC re-ranking is beneficial for leveraging the extensive pre-trained knowledge and powerful generative capabilities. However, it may encounter new problems when accomplishing the task, namely mismatch, misordering and omission. To this end, we introduce KC-GenRe, a knowledge-constrained generative re-ranking method based on LLMs for KGC. To overcome the mismatch issue, we formulate the KGC re-ranking task as a candidate identifier sorting generation problem implemented by generative LLMs. To tackle the misordering issue, we develop a knowledge-guided interactive training method that enhances the identification and ranking of candidates. To address the omission issue, we design a knowledge-augmented constrained inference method that enables contextual prompting and controlled generation, so as to obtain valid rankings. Experimental results show that KG-GenRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, with gains of up to 6.7% and 7.7% in the MRR and Hits@1 metric compared to previous methods, and 9.0% and 11.1% compared to that without re-ranking. Extensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of components in KG-GenRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with GNNs and Rules: An Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07942v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04521v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs. The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution. Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution. Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions. Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization. The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors.</p></details> |  |

This framework is crucial for integrating structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale, aiming to alleviate issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, to evaluate models' ability to accurately embed entities within MMKGs, we focus on two widely researched tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking for the robust integration of multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets (three for MKGC and seven for MEMA), demonstrating its robustness and versatility. Besides, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

In this paper, we introduce Hyper-CL, an efficient methodology that integrates hypernetworks with contrastive learning to compute conditioned sentence representations. In our proposed approach, the hypernetwork is responsible for transforming pre-computed condition embeddings into corresponding projection layers. This enables the same sentence embeddings to be projected differently according to various conditions. Evaluation on two representative conditioning benchmarks, namely conditional semantic text similarity and knowledge graph completion, demonstrates that Hyper-CL is effective in flexibly conditioning sentence representations, showcasing its computational efficiency at the same time. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the inner workings of our approach, leading to a better interpretation of its mechanisms.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we link knowledge graph completion and counterfactual reasoning via our new task CFKGR. We model the original world state as a knowledge graph, hypothetical scenarios as edges added to the graph, and plausible changes to the graph as inferences from logical rules. We create corresponding benchmark datasets, which contain diverse hypothetical scenarios with plausible changes to the original knowledge graph and facts that should be retained. We develop COULDD, a general method for adapting existing knowledge graph embeddings given a hypothetical premise, and evaluate it on our benchmark. Our results indicate that KGEs learn patterns in the graph without explicit training. We further observe that KGEs adapted with COULDD solidly detect plausible counterfactual changes to the graph that follow these patterns. An evaluation on human-annotated data reveals that KGEs adapted with COULDD are mostly unable to recognize changes to the graph that do not follow learned inference rules. In contrast, ChatGPT mostly outperforms KGEs in detecting plausible changes to the graph but has poor knowledge retention. In summary, CFKGR connects two previously distinct areas, namely KG completion and counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2024</p></details> |

However, previous works have paid little attention to Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), a task that is well-known for its significantly higher algorithm complexity. The state-of-the-art KGC solutions based on graph convolution neural network (GCN) involve extensive vertex/relation embedding updates and complicated score functions, which are inherently cumbersome for acceleration. As a result, existing accelerator designs are no longer optimal, and a novel algorithm-hardware co-design for KG reasoning is needed. Recently, brain-inspired HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution for lightweight machine learning, particularly for graph learning applications. In this paper, we leverage HDC for an intrinsically more efficient and acceleration-friendly KGC algorithm. We also co-design an acceleration framework named HDReason targeting FPGA platforms. On the algorithm level, HDReason achieves a balance between high reasoning accuracy, strong model interpretability, and less computation complexity. In terms of architecture, HDReason offers reconfigurability, high training throughput, and low energy consumption. When compared with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, the proposed accelerator achieves an average 10.6x speedup and 65x energy efficiency improvement. When conducting cross-models and cross-platforms comparison, HDReason yields an average 4.2x higher performance and 3.4x better energy efficiency with similar accuracy versus the state-of-the-art FPGA-based GCN training platform.</p></details> |  |

Description-based KGC leverages pre-trained language models to learn entity and relation representations with their names or descriptions, which shows promising results. However, the performance of description-based KGC is still limited by the quality of text and the incomplete structure, as it lacks sufficient entity descriptions and relies solely on relation names, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose MPIKGC, a general framework to compensate for the deficiency of contextualized knowledge and improve KGC by querying large language models (LLMs) from various perspectives, which involves leveraging the reasoning, explanation, and summarization capabilities of LLMs to expand entity descriptions, understand relations, and extract structures, respectively. We conducted extensive evaluation of the effectiveness and improvement of our framework based on four description-based KGC models and four datasets, for both link prediction and triplet classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Most existing methods focus on learning representations based on graph neural networks while inaccurately extracting information from timestamps and insufficiently utilizing the implied information in relations. To address these problems, we propose a novel TKGC model, namely Pre-trained Language Model with Prompts for TKGC (PPT). We convert a series of sampled quadruples into pre-trained language model inputs and convert intervals between timestamps into different prompts to make coherent sentences with implicit semantic information. We train our model with a masking strategy to convert TKGC task into a masked token prediction task, which can leverage the semantic information in pre-trained language models. Experiments on three benchmark datasets and extensive analysis demonstrate that our model has great competitiveness compared to other models with four metrics. Our model can effectively incorporate information from temporal knowledge graphs into the language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2023</p></details> |

Existing methods, operating in real or complex spaces, have demonstrated promising performance in this task. This paper advances beyond conventional approaches by introducing more expressive quaternion representations for TKGC within hypercomplex space. Unlike existing quaternion-based methods, our study focuses on capturing time-sensitive relations rather than time-aware entities. Specifically, we model time-sensitive relations through time-aware rotation and periodic time translation, effectively capturing complex temporal variability. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate our method's capability to model symmetric, asymmetric, inverse, compositional, and evolutionary relation patterns. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets validate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the field of TKGC.</p></details> |  |

Though LLMs can comprehend graph information in a textual format, they overlook the rich visual modality, which is an intuitive way for humans to comprehend structural information and conduct graph reasoning. The potential benefits and capabilities of representing graph structures as visual images (i.e., visual graph) is still unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step in incorporating visual information into graph reasoning tasks and propose a new benchmark GITQA, where each sample is a tuple (graph, image, textual description). We conduct extensive experiments on the GITQA benchmark using state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. Results on graph reasoning tasks show that combining textual and visual information together performs better than using one modality alone. Moreover, the LLaVA-7B/13B models finetuned on the training set (referred to as GITA), achieve higher accuracy than the closed-source model GPT-4(V). We also study the effects of augmentations in graph reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To surmount these challenges, we introduce the Contextualization Distillation strategy, a versatile plug-in-and-play approach compatible with both discriminative and generative KGC frameworks. Our method begins by instructing large language models (LLMs) to transform compact, structural triplets into context-rich segments. Subsequently, we introduce two tailored auxiliary tasks, reconstruction and contextualization, allowing smaller KGC models to assimilate insights from these enriched triplets. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and KGC techniques highlight the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, revealing consistent performance enhancements irrespective of underlying pipelines or architectures. Moreover, our analysis makes our method more explainable and provides insight into generating path selection, as well as the choosing of suitable distillation tasks.

Many models have been proposed for KGC. They can be categorized into two main classes: triple-based and text-based approaches. Triple-based methods struggle with long-tail entities due to limited structural information and imbalanced entity distributions. Text-based methods alleviate this issue but require costly training for language models and specific finetuning for knowledge graphs, which limits their efficiency. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose KICGPT, a framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) and a triple-based KGC retriever. It alleviates the long-tail problem without incurring additional training overhead. KICGPT uses an in-context learning strategy called Knowledge Prompt, which encodes structural knowledge into demonstrations to guide the LLM.

The information from different modalities will work together to measure the triple plausibility. Existing MMKGC methods overlook the imbalance problem of modality information among entities, resulting in inadequate modal fusion and inefficient utilization of the raw modality information. To address the mentioned problems, we propose Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion and Modality Adversarial Training (AdaMF-MAT) to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information for MMKGC. AdaMF-MAT achieves multi-modal fusion with adaptive modality weights and further generates adversarial samples by modality-adversarial training to enhance the imbalanced modality information. Our approach is a co-design of the MMKGC model and training strategy which can outperform 19 recent MMKGC methods and achieve new state-of-the-art results on three public MMKGC benchmarks.

Most embedding methods assume that all test entities are available during training, which makes it time-consuming to retrain embeddings for newly emerging entities. To address this issue, recent works apply the graph neural network on the existing neighbors of the unseen entities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Virtual Neighbor (VN) network, to address three key challenges. Firstly, to reduce the neighbor sparsity problem, we introduce the concept of the virtual neighbors inferred by rules. And we assign soft labels to these neighbors by solving a rule-constrained problem, rather than simply regarding them as unquestionably true. Secondly, many existing methods only use one-hop or two-hop neighbors for aggregation and ignore the distant information that may be helpful. Instead, we identify both logic and symmetric path rules to capture complex patterns. Finally, instead of one-time injection of rules, we employ an iterative learning scheme between the embedding method and virtual neighbor prediction to capture the interactions within. Experimental results on two knowledge graph completion tasks demonstrate that our VN network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, results on Subject/Object-R show that our proposed VN network is highly robust to the neighbor sparsity problem.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Comprehensive experiments are undertaken on several widely recognized datasets, revealing that our framework exceeds or parallels existing methods across numerous popular metrics.

Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama-2-13B, we obtain the UrbanKGC agent, UrbanKGent-13B. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent-13B not only can significantly outperform 21 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10\% with approximately 20 times lower cost. We deploy UrbanKGent-13B to provide online services, which can construct an UrbanKG with thousands of times richer relationships using only one-fifth of the data compared with the existing benchmark.

| **[Are We Wasting Time? A Fast, Accurate Performance Evaluation Framework for Knowledge Graph Link Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00053v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard evaluation protocol for measuring the quality of Knowledge Graph Completion methods - the task of inferring new links to be added to a graph - typically involves a step which ranks every entity of a Knowledge Graph to assess their fit as a head or tail of a candidate link to be added. In Knowledge Graphs on a larger scale, this task rapidly becomes prohibitively heavy. Previous approaches mitigate this problem by using random sampling of entities to assess the quality of links predicted or suggested by a method. However, we show that this approach has serious limitations since the ranking metrics produced do not properly reflect true outcomes. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of these effects along with the following findings. First, we empirically find and theoretically motivate why sampling uniformly at random vastly overestimates the ranking performance of a method. We show that this can be attributed to the effect of easy versus hard negative candidates. Second, we propose a framework that uses relational recommenders to guide the selection of candidates for evaluation. We provide both theoretical and empirical justification of our methodology, and find that simple and fast methods can work extremely well, and that they match advanced neural approaches. Even when a large portion of true candidates for a property are missed, the estimation barely deteriorates. With our proposed framework, we can reduce the time and computation needed similar to random sampling strategies while vastly improving the estimation; on ogbl-wikikg2, we show that accurate estimations of the full, filtered ranking can be obtained in 20 seconds instead of 30 minutes. We conclude that considerable computational effort can be saved by effective preprocessing and sampling methods and still reliably predict performance accurately of the true performance for the entire ranking procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Distillation Based on Masked Generation Feature Method for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12997v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, knowledge graph completion (KGC) models based on pre-trained language model (PLM) have shown promising results. However, the large number of parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However, traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7\% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Can Text-based Knowledge Graph Completion Benefit From Zero-Shot Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08279v2)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods, leveraging textual entity descriptions are at the research forefront. The efficacy of these models hinges on the quality of the textual data. This study explores whether enriched or more efficient textual descriptions can amplify model performance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in NLP tasks, attributed to their sophisticated text generation and conversational capabilities. LLMs assimilate linguistic patterns and integrate knowledge from their training data. Compared to traditional databases like Wikipedia, LLMs provide several advantages, facilitating broader information querying and content augmentation. We hypothesize that LLMs, without fine-tuning, can refine entity descriptions, serving as an auxiliary knowledge source. An in-depth analysis was conducted to verify this hypothesis. We found that (1) without fine-tuning, LLMs have the capability to further improve the quality of entity text descriptions. We validated this through experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets. (2) LLMs exhibit text generation hallucination issues and selectively output words with multiple meanings. This was mitigated by contextualizing prompts to constrain LLM outputs. (3) Larger model sizes do not necessarily guarantee better performance; even the 7B model can achieve optimized results in this comparative task. These findings underscore the untapped potential of large models in text-based KGC, which is a promising direction for further research in KGC.

Law enforcement agencies can effectively maintain social security and precisely combat criminal activities by analyzing the aforementioned data. In comparison to traditional data analysis methods, deep learning models, relying on the robust computational power in cloud centers, exhibit higher accuracy in extracting data features and inferring data. However, within the architecture of cloud centers, the transmission of data from end devices introduces significant latency, hindering real-time inference of data. Furthermore, low-latency edge computing architectures face limitations in direct deployment due to relatively weak computing and storage capacities of nodes. To address these challenges, a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture that utilizes knowledge graph embedding for data analysis. Subsequently, to filter out substandard data, a personnel data quality assessment method named PDQA is proposed. Lastly, we present a model pruning algorithm that significantly reduces the model size while maximizing performance, enabling lightweight deployment. In experiments, we compare the effects of 11 advanced models on completing the knowledge graph of public security personnel information. The results indicate that the RotatE model outperforms other models significantly in knowledge graph completion, with the pruned model size reduced by 70\%, and hits@10 reaching 86.97\%.}</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, Has been accepted by Wireless Network</p></details> |
| **[Path-based Explanation for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02290v1)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) by modelling how entities and relations interact in recent years. However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three new metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a qualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link outperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

While training KGC models on multiple aligned KGs can improve performance, previous methods that rely on transferring raw data among KGs raise privacy concerns. To address this challenge, we propose a new federated learning framework that implicitly aggregates knowledge from multiple KGs without demanding raw data exchange and entity alignment. We treat each KG as a client that trains a local language model through textbased knowledge representation learning. A central server then aggregates the model weights from clients. As natural language provides a universal representation, the same knowledge thus has similar semantic representations across KGs. As such, the aggregated language model can leverage complementary knowledge from multilingual KGs without demanding raw user data sharing. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method substantially improves KGC on multilingual KGs, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art alignment-based models without requiring any labeled alignments or raw user data sharing. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConvD: Attention Enhanced Dynamic Convolutional Embeddings for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07589v1)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs generally suffer from incompleteness, which can be alleviated by completing the missing information. Deep knowledge convolutional embedding models based on neural networks are currently popular methods for knowledge graph completion. However, most existing methods use external convolution kernels and traditional plain convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model ConvD for knowledge graph completion, which directly reshapes the relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels to improve the external convolution kernels of the traditional convolutional embedding model. The internal convolution kernels can effectively augment the feature interaction between the relation embeddings and entity embeddings, thus enhancing the model embedding performance. Moreover, we design a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism, which can assign different contribution weight coefficients to multiple relation convolution kernels for dynamic convolution to improve the expressiveness of the model further. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 11.30\% to 16.92\% across all model evaluation metrics. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of each component module of the ConvD model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Disentangled Embeddings for Knowledge Graph Completion with Pre-trained Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01837v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both graph structures and textual information play a critical role in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). With the success of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT, they have been applied for text encoding for KGC. However, the current methods mostly prefer to fine-tune PLMs, leading to huge training costs and limited scalability to larger PLMs. In contrast, we propose to utilize prompts and perform KGC on a frozen PLM with only the prompts trained. Accordingly, we propose a new KGC method named PDKGC with two prompts -- a hard task prompt which is to adapt the KGC task to the PLM pre-training task of token prediction, and a disentangled structure prompt which learns disentangled graph representation so as to enable the PLM to combine more relevant structure knowledge with the text information. With the two prompts, PDKGC builds a textual predictor and a structural predictor, respectively, and their combination leads to more comprehensive entity prediction. Solid evaluation on two widely used KGC datasets has shown that PDKGC often outperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art, and its components are all effective.

However, when it comes to non-English languages, the quantity and quality of textual information are comparatively scarce. To address this issue, we introduce the novel task of automatic Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE) and perform a thorough investigation on bridging the gap in both the quantity and quality of textual information between English and non-English languages. More specifically, we: i) bring to light the problem of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of entity names and descriptions in Wikidata; ii) demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods, namely, Machine Translation (MT), Web Search (WS), and Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with this task; iii) present M-NTA, a novel unsupervised approach that combines MT, WS, and LLMs to generate high-quality textual information; and, iv) study the impact of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of non-English textual information in Entity Linking, Knowledge Graph Completion, and Question Answering. As part of our effort towards better multilingual knowledge graphs, we also introduce WikiKGE-10, the first human-curated benchmark to evaluate KGE approaches in 10 languages across 7 language families.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready for EMNLP 2023</p></details> |

However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommendation. Experimental results on six datasets show that Relphormer can obtain better performance compared with baselines.

In real-world scenarios, KGs are distributed across clients, complicating completion tasks due to privacy restrictions. Many frameworks have been proposed to address the issue of federated knowledge graph completion. However, the existing frameworks, including FedE, FedR, and FEKG, have certain limitations. = FedE poses a risk of information leakage, FedR's optimization efficacy diminishes when there is minimal overlap among relations, and FKGE suffers from computational costs and mode collapse issues. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, i.e., Federated Latent Embedding Sharing Tensor factorization (FLEST), which is a novel approach using federated tensor factorization for KG completion. FLEST decompose the embedding matrix and enables sharing of latent dictionary embeddings to lower privacy risks. Empirical results demonstrate FLEST's effectiveness and efficiency, offering a balanced solution between performance and privacy. FLEST expands the application of federated tensor factorization in KG completion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2023</p></details> |

Due to the difficulty of manually enumerating all relationships between entities, automatically completing them is essential for KGs. Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a task that infers unseen relationships between entities in a KG. Traditional embedding-based KGC methods, such as RESCAL, TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, HousE, etc., infer missing links using only the knowledge from training data. In contrast, the recent Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based KGC utilizes knowledge obtained during pre-training. Therefore, PLM-based KGC can estimate missing links between entities by reusing memorized knowledge from pre-training without inference. This approach is problematic because building KGC models aims to infer unseen links between entities. However, conventional evaluations in KGC do not consider inference and memorization abilities separately. Thus, a PLM-based KGC method, which achieves high performance in current KGC evaluations, may be ineffective in practical applications. To address this issue, we analyze whether PLM-based KGC methods make inferences or merely access memorized knowledge. For this purpose, we propose a method for constructing synthetic datasets specified in this analysis and conclude that PLMs acquire the inference abilities required for KGC through pre-training, even though the performance improvements mostly come from textual information of entities and relations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However current benchmarks mostly follow the data distribution of the pre-training data of LLMs. Therefore, a natural question rises that do LLMs really understand the structured semantics of formal languages. In this paper, we investigate this problem on a special case, converse binary relation. We introduce a new benchmark ConvRe focusing on converse relations, which contains 17 relations and 1240 triples extracted from popular knowledge graph completion datasets. Our ConvRE features two tasks, Re2Text and Text2Re, which are formulated as multi-choice question answering to evaluate LLMs' ability to determine the matching between relations and associated text. For the evaluation protocol, apart from different prompting methods, we further introduce variants to the test text and few-shot example text. We conduct experiments on three popular LLM families and have observed various scaling trends. The results suggest that LLMs often resort to shortcut learning and still face challenges on our proposed benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2023</p></details> |

In recent, pre-trained language model (PLM) based methods that utilize both textual and structural information are emerging, but their performances lag behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) structure-based methods or some methods lose their inductive inference capabilities in the process of fusing structure embedding to text encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel method to effectively unify structure information and language semantics without losing the power of inductive reasoning. We adopt entity anchors and these anchors and textual description of KG elements are fed together into the PLM-based encoder to learn unified representations. In addition, the proposed method utilizes additional random negative samples which can be reused in the each mini-batch during contrastive learning to learn a generalized entity representations. We verify the effectiveness of the our proposed method through various experiments and analysis. The experimental results on standard benchmark widely used in link prediction task show that the proposed model outperforms existing the SOTA KGC models. Especially, our method show the largest performance improvement on FB15K-237, which is competitive to the SOTA of structure-based KGC methods.</p></details> |  |

Preliminary experiments show that these approaches have complementary strengths: structure-based models perform well when the gold answer is easily reachable from the query head in the KG, while textual models exploit descriptions to give good performance even when the gold answer is not reachable. In response, we explore ensembling as a way of combining the best of both approaches. We propose a novel method for learning query-dependent ensemble weights by using the distributions of scores assigned by individual models to all candidate entities. Our ensemble baseline achieves state-of-the-art results on three standard KGC datasets, with up to 6.8 pt MRR and 8.3 pt Hits@1 gains over best individual models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) techniques aim to address this issue. However, traditional KGC methods are computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale KGs, necessitating the learning of dense node embeddings and computing pairwise distances. Generative transformer-based language models (e.g., T5 and recent KGT5) offer a promising solution as they can predict the tail nodes directly. In this study, we propose to include node neighborhoods as additional information to improve KGC methods based on language models. We examine the effects of this imputation and show that, on both inductive and transductive Wikidata subsets, our method outperforms KGT5 and conventional KGC approaches. We also provide an extensive analysis of the impact of neighborhood on model prediction and show its importance.

A new class of methods have been proposed to tackle this problem by aggregating path information. These methods have shown tremendous ability in the task of KGC. However they are plagued by efficiency issues. Though there are a few recent attempts to address this through learnable path pruning, they often sacrifice the performance to gain efficiency. In this work, we identify two intrinsic limitations of these methods that affect the efficiency and representation quality. To address the limitations, we introduce a new method, TAGNet, which is able to efficiently propagate information. This is achieved by only aggregating paths in a fixed window for each source-target pair. We demonstrate that the complexity of TAGNet is independent of the number of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAGNet can cut down on the number of propagated messages by as much as 90% while achieving competitive performance on multiple KG datasets.

Existing research mostly encodes entities and relations using sequential graph neural networks applied to recent snapshots. However, these approaches tend to overlook the ability to skip irrelevant snapshots according to entity-related relations in the query and disregard the importance of explicit temporal information. To address this, we propose our model, Re-Temp (Relation-Aware Temporal Representation Learning), which leverages explicit temporal embedding as input and incorporates skip information flow after each timestamp to skip unnecessary information for prediction. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase forward propagation method to prevent information leakage. Through the evaluation on six TKGC (extrapolation) datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms all eight recent state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2023</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a node neighborhood-enhanced framework for knowledge graph completion. It models the head entity neighborhood from multiple hops using graph neural networks to enrich the head node information. Moreover, we introduce an additional edge link prediction task to improve KGC. Evaluation on two public datasets shows that this framework is simple yet effective.

In the training process of KGEs, negative sampling is essential to find high-quality negative triples since KGs only contain positive triples. Most existing negative sampling methods assume that non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples. However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise. Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also be true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false negative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable denoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by refining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled unlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative triple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself. Secondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to synthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple. Experimental results on the knowledge graph completion task show that the proposed DeMix is superior to other negative sampling techniques, ensuring corresponding KGEs a faster convergence and better link prediction results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISWC 2023</p></details> |

However, research about LLM-based KGC is limited and lacks effective utilization of LLM's inference capabilities, which ignores the important structural information in KGs and prevents LLMs from acquiring accurate factual knowledge. In this paper, we discuss how to incorporate the helpful KG structural information into the LLMs, aiming to achieve structrual-aware reasoning in the LLMs. We first transfer the existing LLM paradigms to structural-aware settings and further propose a knowledge prefix adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. KoPA employs structural embedding pre-training to capture the structural information of entities and relations in the KG. Then KoPA informs the LLMs of the knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments on these structural-aware LLM-based KGC methods and provide an in-depth analysis comparing how the introduction of structural information would be better for LLM's knowledge reasoning ability. Our code is released at https://github.com/zjukg/KoPA.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Time Interval Prediction in Text-Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16357v1)** | 2023-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods learn latent representations of entities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space. Although the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a large number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the time instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are often known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may also contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal information and textual descriptions are not taken into account during representation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information of the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal information to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual descriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities that have not been seen in training). We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph completion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously unseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts. Unlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across different time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the performance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval prediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple classification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Among the current studies, text-based methods complete the task by utilizing textual descriptions of triples. However, this modeling approach may encounter limitations, particularly when the description fails to accurately and adequately express the intended meaning. To overcome these challenges, we propose the augmentation of data through two additional mechanisms. Firstly, we employ ChatGPT as an external knowledge base to generate coherent descriptions to bridge the semantic gap between the queries and answers. Secondly, we leverage inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby creating extra labeling and providing supplementary information for link prediction. This approach offers additional insights into the relationships between entities. Through these efforts, we have observed significant improvements in knowledge graph completion, as these mechanisms enhance the richness and diversity of the available data, leading to more accurate results.</p></details> |  |

Although bilinear based models have achieved significant advances, these studies mainly concentrate on posterior properties (based on evidence, e.g. symmetry pattern) while neglecting the prior properties. In this paper, we find a prior property named "the law of identity" that cannot be captured by bilinear based models, which hinders them from comprehensively modeling the characteristics of KGs. To address this issue, we introduce a solution called Unit Ball Bilinear Model (UniBi). This model not only achieves theoretical superiority but also offers enhanced interpretability and performance by minimizing ineffective learning through minimal constraints. Experiments demonstrate that UniBi models the prior property and verify its interpretability and performance.</p></details> |  |

Prediction quality can be improved by calibrating the scoring model, typically by adjusting the prediction thresholds using manually annotated examples. In this paper, we attempt for the first time cold-start calibration for KGC, where no annotated examples exist initially for calibration, and only a limited number of tuples can be selected for annotation. Our new method ACTC finds good per-relation thresholds efficiently based on a limited set of annotated tuples. Additionally to a few annotated tuples, ACTC also leverages unlabeled tuples by estimating their correctness with Logistic Regression or Gaussian Process classifiers. We also experiment with different methods for selecting candidate tuples for annotation: density-based and random selection. Experiments with five scoring models and an oracle annotator show an improvement of 7% points when using ACTC in the challenging setting with an annotation budget of only 10 tuples, and an average improvement of 4% points over different budgets.</p></details> | ACL'23 |

Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules.

However, current subsampling approaches consider only frequencies of queries that consist of entities and their relations. Thus, the existing subsampling potentially underestimates the appearance probabilities of infrequent queries even if the frequencies of their entities or relations are high. To address this problem, we propose Model-based Subsampling (MBS) and Mixed Subsampling (MIX) to estimate their appearance probabilities through predictions of KGE models. Evaluation results on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 showed that our proposed subsampling methods actually improved the KG completion performances for popular KGE models, RotatE, TransE, HAKE, ComplEx, and DistMult.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AACL 2023; 9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Text-based KG embeddings can represent entities by encoding descriptions with pre-trained language models, but no open-sourced library is specifically designed for KGs with PLMs at present. In this paper, we present LambdaKG, a library for KGE that equips with many pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, BART, T5, GPT-3), and supports various tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, question answering, recommendation, and knowledge probing).

| **[Extending Transductive Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Inductive Logical Relational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many downstream inference tasks for knowledge graphs, such as relation prediction, have been handled successfully by knowledge graph embedding techniques in the transductive setting. To address the inductive setting wherein new entities are introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time, more recent work opts for models which learn implicit representations of the knowledge graph through a complex function of a network's subgraph structure, often parametrized by graph neural network architectures. These come at the cost of increased parametrization, reduced interpretability and limited generalization to other downstream inference tasks. In this work, we bridge the gap between traditional transductive knowledge graph embedding approaches and more recent inductive relation prediction models by introducing a generalized form of harmonic extension which leverages representations learned through transductive embedding methods to infer representations of new entities introduced at inference time as in the inductive setting. This harmonic extension technique provides the best such approximation, can be implemented via an efficient iterative scheme, and can be employed to answer a family of conjunctive logical queries over the knowledge graph, further expanding the capabilities of transductive embedding methods. In experiments on a number of large-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, we find that this approach for extending the functionality of transductive knowledge graph embedding models to perform knowledge graph completion and answer logical queries in the inductive setting is competitive with--and in some scenarios outperforms--several state-of-the-art models derived explicitly for such inductive tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iteratively Learning Representations for Unseen Entities with Inter-Rule Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10531v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on knowledge graph completion (KGC) focused on learning embeddings of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. These embedding methods require that all test entities are observed at training time, resulting in a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities. To address this issue, current inductive knowledge embedding methods employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating information of known neighbors. They face three important challenges: (i) data sparsity, (ii) the presence of complex patterns in knowledge graphs (e.g., inter-rule correlations), and (iii) the presence of interactions among rule mining, rule inference, and embedding. In this paper, we propose a virtual neighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) that consists of three stages: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. In the rule mining process, to identify complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic rules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on operations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual neighbors for OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a rule-constrained problem. We also devise an iterative framework to capture the underlying relations between rule learning and embedding learning. In our experiments, results on both link prediction and triple classification tasks show that the proposed VNC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used knowledge graphs. Further analysis reveals that VNC is robust to the proportion of unseen entities and effectively mitigates data sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2023</p></details> |

The rule aggregation problem is concerned with finding one plausibility score for a candidate fact which was simultaneously predicted by multiple rules. Although the problem is ubiquitous, as data-driven rule learning can result in noisy and large rulesets, it is underrepresented in the literature and its theoretical foundations have not been studied before in this context. In this work, we demonstrate that existing aggregation approaches can be expressed as marginal inference operations over the predicting rules. In particular, we show that the common Max-aggregation strategy, which scores candidates based on the rule with the highest confidence, has a probabilistic interpretation. Finally, we propose an efficient and overlooked baseline which combines the previous strategies and is competitive to computationally more expensive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>KLR W...</summary><p>KLR Workshop@ICML2023</p></details> |

While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)</p></details> |

Existing methods can mainly be categorized into structure-based or description-based. On the one hand, structure-based methods effectively represent relational facts in knowledge graphs using entity embeddings. However, they struggle with semantically rich real-world entities due to limited structural information and fail to generalize to unseen entities. On the other hand, description-based methods leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to understand textual information. They exhibit strong robustness towards unseen entities. However, they have difficulty with larger negative sampling and often lag behind structure-based methods. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose Momentum Contrast for knowledge graph completion with Structure-Augmented pre-trained language models (MoCoSA), which allows the PLM to perceive the structural information by the adaptable structure encoder. To improve learning efficiency, we proposed momentum hard negative and intra-relation negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with improvements of 2.5% on WN18RR and 21% on OpenBG500.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Study on Knowledge Graph Embedding over Relational Patterns Based on Rule Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07889v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has proven to be an effective approach to solving the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task. Relational patterns which refer to relations with specific semantics exhibiting graph patterns are an important factor in the performance of KGE models. Though KGE models' capabilities are analyzed over different relational patterns in theory and a rough connection between better relational patterns modeling and better performance of KGC has been built, a comprehensive quantitative analysis on KGE models over relational patterns remains absent so it is uncertain how the theoretical support of KGE to a relational pattern contributes to the performance of triples associated to such a relational pattern. To address this challenge, we evaluate the performance of 7 KGE models over 4 common relational patterns on 2 benchmarks, then conduct an analysis in theory, entity frequency, and part-to-whole three aspects and get some counterintuitive conclusions. Finally, we introduce a training-free method Score-based Patterns Adaptation (SPA) to enhance KGE models' performance over various relational patterns. This approach is simple yet effective and can be applied to KGE models without additional training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method generally enhances performance over specific relational patterns.

MMKGC enhances knowledge graph completion (KGC) by integrating multi-modal entity information, thereby facilitating the discovery of unobserved triples in the large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Nevertheless, existing methods emphasize the design of elegant KGC models to facilitate modality interaction, neglecting the real-life problem of missing modalities in KGs. The missing modality information impedes modal interaction, consequently undermining the model's performance. In this paper, we propose a modality adversarial and contrastive framework (MACO) to solve the modality-missing problem in MMKGC. MACO trains a generator and discriminator adversarially to generate missing modality features that can be incorporated into the MMKGC model. Meanwhile, we design a cross-modal contrastive loss to improve the performance of the generator. Experiments on public benchmarks with further explorations demonstrate that MACO could achieve state-of-the-art results and serve as a versatile framework to bolster various MMKGC models.

| **[HyperFormer: Enhancing Entity and Relation Interaction for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06512v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) extend standard knowledge graphs by associating attribute-value qualifiers to triples, which effectively represent additional fine-grained information about its associated triple. Hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) aims at inferring unknown triples while considering its qualifiers. Most existing approaches to HKGC exploit a global-level graph structure to encode hyper-relational knowledge into the graph convolution message passing process. However, the addition of multi-hop information might bring noise into the triple prediction process. To address this problem, we propose HyperFormer, a model that considers local-level sequential information, which encodes the content of the entities, relations and qualifiers of a triple. More precisely, HyperFormer is composed of three different modules: an entity neighbor aggregator module allowing to integrate the information of the neighbors of an entity to capture different perspectives of it; a relation qualifier aggregator module to integrate hyper-relational knowledge into the corresponding relation to refine the representation of relational content; a convolution-based bidirectional interaction module based on a convolutional operation, capturing pairwise bidirectional interactions of entity-relation, entity-qualifier, and relation-qualifier. realize the depth perception of the content related to the current statement. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy into the feed-forward layers of HyperFormer to strengthen its representation capabilities while reducing the amount of model parameters and computation. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets with four different conditions demonstrate HyperFormer's effectiveness. Datasets and code are available at https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/HKGC-HyperFormer.</p></details> | Accepted at CIKM'23 |

However, they usually cannot avoid rule grounding, and injecting a diverse set of rules has still not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we propose InjEx, a mechanism to inject multiple types of rules through simple constraints, which capture definite Horn rules. To start, we theoretically prove that InjEx can inject such rules. Next, to demonstrate that InjEx infuses interpretable prior knowledge into the embedding space, we evaluate InjEx on both the knowledge graph completion (KGC) and few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) settings. Our experimental results reveal that InjEx outperforms both baseline KGC models as well as specialized few-shot models while maintaining its scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, TKGs often suffer from incompleteness for three main reasons: the continuous emergence of new knowledge, the weakness of the algorithm for extracting structured information from unstructured data, and the lack of information in the source dataset. Thus, the task of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) has attracted increasing attention, aiming to predict missing items based on the available information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on the algorithms they utilize. We further pinpoint the challenges and discuss future research directions of TKGC.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different description logic axioms. We conclude the paper with a critical reflection on the current state of work in the community and give recommendations for future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausE: Towards Causal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11610v2)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) focuses on representing the entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into the continuous vector spaces, which can be employed to predict the missing triples to achieve knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, KGE models often only briefly learn structural correlations of triple data and embeddings would be misled by the trivial patterns and noisy links in real-world KGs. To address this issue, we build the new paradigm of KGE in the context of causality and embedding disentanglement. We further propose a Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding (CausE) framework. CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CausE could outperform the baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art KGC performance.

However, the currently constructed knowledge graphs need to be complemented for better knowledge in terms of relations. It is called knowledge graph completion. To add new relations to the existing knowledge graph by using knowledge graph embedding models, we have to evaluate $N\times N \times R$ vector operations, where $N$ is the number of entities and $R$ is the number of relation types. It is very costly. In this paper, we provide an efficient knowledge graph completion framework on GPUs to get new relations using knowledge graph embedding vectors. In the proposed framework, we first define "transformable to a metric space" and then provide a method to transform the knowledge graph completion problem into the similarity join problem for a model which is "transformable to a metric space". After that, to efficiently process the similarity join problem, we derive formulas using the properties of a metric space. Based on the formulas, we develop a fast knowledge graph completion algorithm. Finally, we experimentally show that our framework can efficiently process the knowledge graph completion problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separate-and-Aggregate: A Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05627v1)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of inferencing missing facts from any given knowledge graphs (KG). Previous KGC methods typically represent knowledge graph entities and relations as trainable continuous embeddings and fuse the embeddings of the entity $h$ (or $t$) and relation $r$ into hidden representations of query $(h, r, ?)$ (or $(?, r, t$)) to approximate the missing entities. To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness of our model design choices in PatReFormer. We then find that PatReFormer can better capture KG information from a large relation embedding dimension. Finally, we demonstrate that the strength of PatReFormer is at complex relation types, compared to other KGC models</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ADMA 2023, oral</p></details> |

Most prior KGC work focuses on learning embeddings for entities and relations through a simple scoring function. Yet, a higher-dimensional embedding space is usually required for a better reasoning capability, which leads to a larger model size and hinders applicability to real-world problems (e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile/edge computing). A lightweight modularized KGC solution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this work to address this issue. GreenKGC consists of three modules: representation learning, feature pruning, and decision learning, to extract discriminant KG features and make accurate predictions on missing relationships using classifiers and negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that, in low dimensions, GreenKGC can outperform SOTA methods in most datasets. In addition, low-dimensional GreenKGC can achieve competitive or even better performance against high-dimensional models with a much smaller model size.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL2023 |

Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used to learn the textual information, usually under the fine-tune paradigm for the KGC task. However, the fine-tuned PLMs often overwhelmingly focus on the textual information and overlook structural knowledge. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes CSProm-KG (Conditional Soft Prompts for KGC) which maintains a balance between structural information and textual knowledge. CSProm-KG only tunes the parameters of Conditional Soft Prompts that are generated by the entities and relations representations. We verify the effectiveness of CSProm-KG on three popular static KGC benchmarks WN18RR, FB15K-237 and Wikidata5M, and two temporal KGC benchmarks ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15. CSProm-KG outperforms competitive baseline models and sets new state-of-the-art on these benchmarks. We conduct further analysis to show (i) the effectiveness of our proposed components, (ii) the efficiency of CSProm-KG, and (iii) the flexibility of CSProm-KG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2023 Findings, Long Paper</p></details> |

Despite great efforts in creation and maintenance, even the largest KGs are far from complete. Hence, KG completion (KGC) has become one of the most crucial tasks for KG research. Recently, considerable literature in this space has centered around the use of Message Passing (Graph) Neural Networks (MPNNs), to learn powerful embeddings. The success of these methods is naturally attributed to the use of MPNNs over simpler multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, given their additional message passing (MP) component. In this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve comparable performance to MPNNs, suggesting that MP may not be as crucial as previously believed. With further exploration, we show careful scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC model performance. This suggests a conflation of scoring function design, loss function design, and MP in prior work, with promising insights regarding the scalability of state-of-the-art KGC methods today, as well as careful attention to more suitable MP designs for KGC tasks tomorrow.

This problem is also exacerbated because of the widespread existence of sparse KGs in practical applications. To alleviate this challenge, we present a novel framework, LR-GCN, that is able to automatically capture valuable long-range dependency among entities to supplement insufficient structure features and distill logical reasoning knowledge for sparse KGC. The proposed approach comprises two main components: a GNN-based predictor and a reasoning path distiller. The reasoning path distiller explores high-order graph structures such as reasoning paths and encodes them as rich-semantic edges, explicitly compositing long-range dependencies into the predictor. This step also plays an essential role in densifying KGs, effectively alleviating the sparse issue. Furthermore, the path distiller further distills logical reasoning knowledge from these mined reasoning paths into the predictor. These two components are jointly optimized using a well-designed variational EM algorithm. Extensive experiments and analyses on four sparse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Among those, several works have achieved more advanced results via exploiting the structure information on KGs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). However, we observe that entity embeddings aggregated from neighbors in different directions are just simply averaged to complete single-tasks by existing GCN based models, ignoring the specific requirements of forward and backward sub-tasks. In this paper, we propose a Direction-sensitive Multi-task GCN (DsMtGCN) to make full use of the direction information, the multi-head self-attention is applied to specifically combine embeddings in different directions based on various entities and sub-tasks, the geometric constraints are imposed to adjust the distribution of embeddings, and the traditional binary cross-entropy loss is modified to reflect the triple uncertainty.

Current approaches randomly select one negative sample for each reference entity pair to minimize a margin-based ranking loss, which easily leads to a zero-loss problem if the negative sample is far away from the positive sample and then out of the margin. Moreover, the entity should have a different representation under a different context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss (RANA) framework. Specifically, to better utilize the plentiful negative samples and alleviate the zero-loss issue, we strategically select relevant negative samples and design an attention-based loss function to further differentiate the importance of each negative sample. The intuition is that negative samples more similar to positive samples will contribute more to the model. Further, we design a dynamic relation-aware entity encoder for learning a context-dependent entity representation. Experiments demonstrate that RANA outperforms the state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference PAKDD 2023</p></details> |

Nevertheless, most existing embedding models map each relation into a unique vector, overlooking the specific fine-grained semantics of them under different entities. Additionally, the few available fine-grained semantic models rely on clustering algorithms, resulting in limited performance and applicability due to the cumbersome two-stage training process. In this paper, we present a novel method utilizing contextual dictionary lookup, enabling conventional embedding models to learn fine-grained semantics of relations in an end-to-end manner. More specifically, we represent each relation using a dictionary that contains multiple latent semantics. The composition of a given entity and the dictionary's central semantics serves as the context for generating a lookup, thus determining the fine-grained semantics of the relation adaptively. The proposed loss function optimizes both the central and fine-grained semantics simultaneously to ensure their semantic consistency. Besides, we introduce two metrics to assess the validity and accuracy of the dictionary lookup operation. We extend several KGE models with the method, resulting in substantial performance improvements on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Most previous TKGC methods only consider predicting the missing links among the entities seen in the training set, while they are unable to achieve great performance in link prediction concerning newly-emerged unseen entities. Recently, a new task, i.e., TKG few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction, is proposed, where TKGC models are required to achieve great link prediction performance concerning newly-emerged entities that only have few-shot observed examples. In this work, we propose a TKGC method FITCARL that combines few-shot learning with reinforcement learning to solve this task. In FITCARL, an agent traverses through the whole TKG to search for the prediction answer. A policy network is designed to guide the search process based on the traversed path. To better address the data scarcity problem in the few-shot setting, we introduce a module that computes the confidence of each candidate action and integrate it into the policy for action selection. We also exploit the entity concept information with a novel concept regularizer to boost model performance. Experimental results show that FITCARL achieves stat-of-the-art performance on TKG few-shot OOG link prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML/PKDD 2023</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Inferential Benchmarks for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04814v1)** | 2023-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph (KG) completion is the problem of extending an incomplete KG with missing facts. A key feature of Machine Learning approaches for KG completion is their ability to learn inference patterns, so that the predicted facts are the results of applying these patterns to the KG. Standard completion benchmarks, however, are not well-suited for evaluating models' abilities to learn patterns, because the training and test sets of these benchmarks are a random split of a given KG and hence do not capture the causality of inference patterns. We propose a novel approach for designing KG completion benchmarks based on the following principles: there is a set of logical rules so that the missing facts are the results of the rules' application; the training set includes both premises matching rule antecedents and the corresponding conclusions; the test set consists of the results of applying the rules to the training set; the negative examples are designed to discourage the models from learning rules not entailed by the rule set. We use our methodology to generate several benchmarks and evaluate a wide range of existing KG completion systems. Our results provide novel insights on the ability of existing models to induce inference patterns from incomplete KGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2023)</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Learning for Relation Extraction: Recent Advances and New Frontiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02051v2)** | 2023-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relation extraction (RE) involves identifying the relations between entities from unstructured texts. RE serves as the foundation for many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as knowledge graph completion, question answering, and information retrieval. In recent years, deep neural networks have dominated the field of RE and made noticeable progress. Subsequently, the large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have taken the state-of-the-art of RE to a new level. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing deep learning techniques for RE. First, we introduce RE resources, including RE datasets and evaluation metrics. Second, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing works from three perspectives (text representation, context encoding, and triplet prediction). Third, we discuss several important challenges faced by RE and summarize potential techniques to tackle these challenges. Finally, we outline some promising future directions and prospects in this field. This survey is expected to facilitate researchers' collaborative efforts to tackle the challenges of real-life RE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Neural Networks on Matrix Manifolds: A Gyrovector Space Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04560v3)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix manifolds, such as manifolds of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and Grassmann manifolds, appear in many applications. Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[History Repeats: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting For Event-Centric Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18675v1)** | 2023-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) completion models typically rely on having access to the entire graph during training. However, in real-world scenarios, TKG data is often received incrementally as events unfold, leading to a dynamic non-stationary data distribution over time. While one could incorporate fine-tuning to existing methods to allow them to adapt to evolving TKG data, this can lead to forgetting previously learned patterns. Alternatively, retraining the model with the entire updated TKG can mitigate forgetting but is computationally burdensome. To address these challenges, we propose a general continual training framework that is applicable to any TKG completion method, and leverages two key ideas: (i) a temporal regularization that encourages repurposing of less important model parameters for learning new knowledge, and (ii) a clustering-based experience replay that reinforces the past knowledge by selectively preserving only a small portion of the past data. Our experimental results on widely used event-centric TKG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed continual training framework in adapting to new events while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Further, we perform ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each component of our proposed framework. Finally, we investigate the relation between the memory dedicated to experience replay and the benefit gained from our clustering-based sampling strategy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion Via Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17019v1)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nodes in the commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) are normally represented by free-form short text (e.g., word or phrase). Different nodes may represent the same concept. This leads to the problems of edge sparsity and node redundancy, which challenges CSKG representation and completion. On the one hand, edge sparsity limits the performance of graph representation learning; On the other hand, node redundancy makes different nodes corresponding to the same concept have inconsistent relations with other nodes. To address the two problems, we propose a new CSKG completion framework based on Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering (CPNC). Contrastive Pretraining constructs positive and negative head-tail node pairs on CSKG and utilizes contrastive learning to obtain better semantic node representation. Node Clustering aggregates nodes with the same concept into a latent concept, assisting the task of CSKG completion. We evaluate our CPNC approach on two CSKG completion benchmarks (CN-100K and ATOMIC), where CPNC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering can significantly improve the performance of CSKG completion. The source code of CPNC is publicly available on \url{https://github.com/NUSTM/CPNC}.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2023 |

However, the predictive power of KGC methods is often limited by the completeness of the existing knowledge graphs from different sources and languages. In monolingual and multilingual settings, KGs are potentially complementary to each other. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-KG completion, where we focus on maximizing the collective knowledge from different KGs to alleviate the incompleteness of individual KGs. Specifically, we propose a novel method called CKGC-CKD that uses relation-aware graph convolutional network encoder models on both individual KGs and a large fused KG in which seed alignments between KGs are regarded as edges for message propagation. An additional mutual knowledge distillation mechanism is also employed to maximize the knowledge transfer between the models of "global" fused KG and the "local" individual KGs. Experimental results on multilingual datasets have shown that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the KGC task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ENLSP-II workshop at NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |

Existing works that augment KG completion require either (1) factual triples to enlarge the graph reasoning space or (2) manually designed prompts to extract knowledge from a pre-trained language model (PLM), exhibiting limited performance and requiring expensive efforts from experts. To this end, we propose TAGREAL that automatically generates quality query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLM for KG completion. The results show that TAGREAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. We find that TAGREAL has superb performance even with limited training data, outperforming existing embedding-based, graph-based, and PLM-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables.

By learning structural constraints for each training triple, these methods implicitly memorize intrinsic relation rules to infer missing links. However, this paper points out that the multi-hop relation rules are hard to be reliably memorized due to the inherent deficiencies of such implicit memorization strategy, making embedding models underperform in predicting links between distant entity pairs. To alleviate this problem, we present Vertical Learning Paradigm (VLP), which extends embedding models by allowing to explicitly copy target information from related factual triples for more accurate prediction. Rather than solely relying on the implicit memory, VLP directly provides additional cues to improve the generalization ability of embedding models, especially making the distant link prediction significantly easier. Moreover, we also propose a novel relative distance based negative sampling technique (ReD) for more effective optimization. Experiments demonstrate the validity and generality of our proposals on two standard benchmarks.

| **[Logical Entity Representation in Knowledge-Graphs for Differentiable Rule Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12738v1)** | 2023-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic logical rule learning has shown great strength in logical rule mining and knowledge graph completion. It learns logical rules to predict missing edges by reasoning on existing edges in the knowledge graph. However, previous efforts have largely been limited to only modeling chain-like Horn clauses such as $R_1(x,z)\land R_2(z,y)\Rightarrow H(x,y)$. This formulation overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of entity variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. Intuitively, there is a large gap here, as local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical functions on the entity's neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules. LERP can also be further combined with embedding learning methods like TransE to make it more interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures; accepted by 11th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023)</p></details> |

Specifically, we first propose a dynamic pruning technique to obtain a small pruned model from a large source model, where the pruning mask of the pruned model could be updated adaptively per epoch after the model weights are updated. The pruned model is supposed to be more sensitive to difficult to memorize samples(e.g., longtail samples) than the source model. Then, we propose a onestep meta selfdistillation method for distilling comprehensive knowledge from the source model to the pruned model, where the two models coevolve in a dynamic manner during training. In particular, we exploit the performance of the pruned model, which is trained alongside the source model in one iteration, to improve the source models knowledge transfer ability for the next iteration via meta learning. Extensive experiments show that MetaSD achieves competitive performance compared to strong baselines, while being 10x smaller than baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the lack of a large-scale, comprehensive, and easy-to-use resource capturing the myriad relationships between publications, their authors, and venues presents a barrier to applications for gaining a deeper understanding of science. In this paper, we present PubGraph, a new resource for studying scientific progress that takes the form of a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) with more than 385M entities, 13B main edges, and 1.5B qualifier edges. PubGraph is comprehensive and unifies data from various sources, including Wikidata, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, using the Wikidata ontology. Beyond the metadata available from these sources, PubGraph includes outputs from auxiliary community detection algorithms and large language models. To further support studies on reasoning over scientific networks, we create several large-scale benchmarks extracted from PubGraph for the core task of knowledge graph completion (KGC). These benchmarks present many challenges for knowledge graph embedding models, including an adversarial community-based KGC evaluation setting, zero-shot inductive learning, and large-scale learning. All of the aforementioned resources are accessible at https://pubgraph.isi.edu/ and released under the CC-BY-SA license. We plan to update PubGraph quarterly to accommodate the release of new publications.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 6 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

Knowledge graphs are often incomplete in the information they represent, necessitating the need for knowledge graph completion tasks. Pre-trained and fine-tuned language models have shown promise in these tasks although these models ignore the intrinsic information encoded in the knowledge graph, namely the entity and relation types. In this work, we propose the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) architecture, where we introduce a new entity/relation embedding layer that learns to differentiate distinctive entity and relation types, therefore allowing the model to learn the structure of the knowledge graph. In this work, we show that further pre-training the language models with this additional embedding layer using the triples extracted from the knowledge graph, followed by the standard fine-tuning phase sets a new state-of-the-art performance for the link prediction task on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, relation labeling in KGs remains a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce domains and the associated cost of human labor. Recently, breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising results in numerous natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of LLMs for relation labeling in e-commerce KGs, investigating their powerful learning capabilities in natural language and effectiveness in predicting relations between product types with limited labeled data. We evaluate various LLMs, including PaLM and GPT-3.5, on benchmark datasets, demonstrating their ability to achieve competitive performance compared to humans on relation labeling tasks using just 1 to 5 labeled examples per relation. Additionally, we experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to examine their impact on model performance. Our results show that LLMs significantly outperform existing KG completion models in relation labeling for e-commerce KGs and exhibit performance strong enough to replace human labeling.</p></details> |  |

The KGC methods fall into multiple categories including embedding-based, rule-based, GNN-based, pretrained Language Model based approaches. However, such dimensions have not been explored in TKG. To that end, we propose a novel temporal neuro-symbolic model, NeuSTIP, that performs link prediction and time interval prediction in a TKG. NeuSTIP learns temporal rules in the presence of the Allen predicates that ensure the temporal consistency between neighboring predicates in a given rule. We further design a unique scoring function that evaluates the confidence of the candidate answers while performing link prediction and time interval prediction by utilizing the learned rules. Our empirical evaluation on two time interval based TKGC datasets suggests that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for both link prediction and the time interval prediction task.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 Figures |

Predicting events is extremely challenging due to the time-sensitive property of events. Besides, the previous TKG completion (TKGC) approaches cannot represent both the timeliness and the causality properties of events, simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a Logic and Commonsense-Guided Embedding model (LCGE) to jointly learn the time-sensitive representation involving timeliness and causality of events, together with the time-independent representation of events from the perspective of commonsense. Specifically, we design a temporal rule learning algorithm to construct a rule-guided predicate embedding regularization strategy for learning the causality among events. Furthermore, we could accurately evaluate the plausibility of events via auxiliary commonsense knowledge. The experimental results of TKGC task illustrate the significant performance improvements of our model compared with the existing approaches. More interestingly, our model is able to provide the explainability of the predicted results in the view of causal inference.

Companies do not only need to react to a dynamic environment but have to act proactively and implement measures to prevent production delays and reduce risks in the supply chains. However, information about supply chains, especially at the deeper levels, is often intransparent and incomplete, making it difficult to obtain precise predictions about prospective risks. By connecting different data sources, we model the supply network as a knowledge graph and achieve transparency up to tier-3 suppliers. To predict missing information in the graph, we apply state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods and attain a mean reciprocal rank of 0.4377 with the best model. Further, we apply graph analysis algorithms to identify critical entities in the supply network, supporting supply chain managers in automated risk identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the D2R2 workshop (ESWC 2023)</p></details> |

Their preservation of relational structures and their appealing properties and interpretability have led to their uptake for tasks such as knowledge graph completion, ontology and hierarchy reasoning, logical query answering, and hierarchical multi-label classification. We survey methods that underly geometric relational embeddings and categorize them based on (i) the embedding geometries that are used to represent the data; and (ii) the relational reasoning tasks that they aim to improve. We identify the desired properties (i.e., inductive biases) of each kind of embedding and discuss some potential future work.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Recently, few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations with few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from practitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on metric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the out-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent at estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as model predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore, most of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in KGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a normalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion (NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to model a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel way to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty. Then, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural process and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve performance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network to capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the existing FKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Traditional embedding-based TKGC models (TKGE) rely on structured connections and can only handle a fixed set of entities, i.e., the transductive setting. In the inductive setting where test TKGs contain emerging entities, the latest methods are based on symbolic rules or pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, they suffer from being inflexible and not time-specific, respectively. In this work, we extend the fully-inductive setting, where entities in the training and test sets are totally disjoint, into TKGs and take a further step towards a more flexible and time-sensitive temporal relation prediction approach SST-BERT, incorporating Structured Sentences with Time-enhanced BERT. Our model can obtain the entity history and implicitly learn rules in the semantic space by encoding structured sentences, solving the problem of inflexibility. We propose to use a time masking MLM task to pre-train BERT in a corpus rich in temporal tokens specially generated for TKGs, enhancing the time sensitivity of SST-BERT. To compute the probability of occurrence of a target quadruple, we aggregate all its structured sentences from both temporal and semantic perspectives into a score. Experiments on the transductive datasets and newly generated fully-inductive benchmarks show that SST-BERT successfully improves over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by Transformer-based pretrained language models' success on learning transferable representation for texts, we introduce a novel inductive KG representation model (iHT) for KG completion by large-scale pre-training. iHT consists of a entity encoder (e.g., BERT) and a neighbor-aware relational scoring function both parameterized by Transformers. We first pre-train iHT on a large KG dataset, Wikidata5M. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on matched evaluations, with a relative improvement of more than 25% in mean reciprocal rank over previous SOTA models. When further fine-tuned on smaller KGs with either entity and relational shifts, pre-trained iHT representations are shown to be transferable, significantly improving the performance on FB15K-237 and WN18RR.</p></details> |  |

However, the efficacy of pretraining tasks has not been fully investigated for downstream large knowledge graph completion tasks. Using a contextualized knowledge graph embedding approach, we investigate five different pretraining signals, constructed using several graph algorithms and no external data, as well as their combination. We leverage the versatility of our Transformer-based model to explore graph structure generation pretraining tasks (i.e. path and k-hop neighborhood generation), typically inapplicable to most graph embedding methods. We further propose a new path-finding algorithm guided by information gain and find that it is the best-performing pretraining task across three downstream knowledge graph completion datasets. While using our new path-finding algorithm as a pretraining signal provides 2-3% MRR improvements, we show that pretraining on all signals together gives the best knowledge graph completion results. In a multitask setting that combines all pretraining tasks, our method surpasses the latest and strong performing knowledge graph embedding methods on all metrics for FB15K-237, on MRR and Hit@1 for WN18RRand on MRR and hit@10 for JF17K (a knowledge hypergraph dataset).</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, training KGEs on non-English knowledge graph promote knowledge extraction and knowledge graph reasoning in the context of these languages. However, many challenges in non-English KGEs pose to learning a low-dimensional representation of a knowledge graph's entities and relations. This paper proposes "Farspredict" a Persian knowledge graph based on Farsbase (the most comprehensive knowledge graph in Persian). It also explains how the knowledge graph structure affects link prediction accuracy in KGE. To evaluate Farspredict, we implemented the popular models of KGE on it and compared the results with Freebase. Given the analysis results, some optimizations on the knowledge graph are carried out to improve its functionality in the KGE. As a result, a new Persian knowledge graph is achieved. Implementation results in the KGE models on Farspredict outperforming Freebases in many cases. At last, we discuss what improvements could be effective in enhancing the quality of Farspredict and how much it improves.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 1 algorithm and 5 tables</p></details> |

As graph data, knowledge graphs accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world. It has been well-recognized that knowledge graphs effectively represent complex information; hence, they rapidly gain the attention of academia and industry in recent years. Thus to develop a deeper understanding of knowledge graphs, this paper presents a systematic overview of this field. Specifically, we focus on the opportunities and challenges of knowledge graphs. We first review the opportunities of knowledge graphs in terms of two aspects: (1) AI systems built upon knowledge graphs; (2) potential application fields of knowledge graphs.

| **[Enhancing Embedding Representations of Biomedical Data using Logic Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13566v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) have become a quite popular class of models specifically devised to deal with ontologies and graph structure data, as they can implicitly encode statistical dependencies between entities and relations in a latent space. KGE techniques are particularly effective for the biomedical domain, where it is quite common to deal with large knowledge graphs underlying complex interactions between biological and chemical objects. Recently in the literature, the PharmKG dataset has been proposed as one of the most challenging knowledge graph biomedical benchmark, with hundreds of thousands of relational facts between genes, diseases and chemicals. Despite KGEs can scale to very large relational domains, they generally fail at representing more complex relational dependencies between facts, like logic rules, which may be fundamental in complex experimental settings. In this paper, we exploit logic rules to enhance the embedding representations of KGEs on the PharmKG dataset. To this end, we adopt Relational Reasoning Network (R2N), a recently proposed neural-symbolic approach showing promising results on knowledge graph completion tasks. An R2N uses the available logic rules to build a neural architecture that reasons over KGE latent representations. In the experiments, we show that our approach is able to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art on the PharmKG dataset. Finally, we provide an ablation study to experimentally compare the effect of alternative sets of rules according to different selection criteria and varying the number of considered rules.</p></details> |  |

Therefore substantial research has been directed toward knowledge graph completion (KGC), i.e., predicting missing triples from the information represented in the knowledge graph (KG). KG embedding models (KGEs) have yielded promising results for KGC, yet any current KGE is incapable of: (1) fully capturing vital inference patterns (e.g., composition), (2) capturing prominent patterns jointly (e.g., hierarchy and composition), and (3) providing an intuitive interpretation of captured patterns. In this work, we propose ExpressivE, a fully expressive spatio-functional KGE that solves all these challenges simultaneously. ExpressivE embeds pairs of entities as points and relations as hyper-parallelograms in the virtual triple space $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. This model design allows ExpressivE not only to capture a rich set of inference patterns jointly but additionally to display any supported inference pattern through the spatial relation of hyper-parallelograms, offering an intuitive and consistent geometric interpretation of ExpressivE embeddings and their captured patterns. Experimental results on standard KGC benchmarks reveal that ExpressivE is competitive with state-of-the-art KGEs and even significantly outperforms them on WN18RR.</p></details> |  |

Except for a few methods based on graph network, most of KGC methods trend to be trained based on independent triples, while are difficult to take a full account of the information of global network connection contained in knowledge network. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a simple and effective Network-based Pre-training framework for knowledge graph completion (termed NetPeace), which takes into account the information of global network connection and local triple relationships in knowledge graph. Experiments show that in NetPeace framework, multiple KGC models yields consistent and significant improvements on benchmarks (e.g., 36.45% Hits@1 and 27.40% MRR improvements for TuckER on FB15k-237), especially dense knowledge graph. On the challenging low-resource task, NetPeace that benefits from the global features of KG achieves higher performance (104.03% MRR and 143.89% Hit@1 improvements at most) than original models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Completion based on Tensor Decomposition for Disease Gene Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09335v2)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate identification of disease genes has consistently been one of the keys to decoding a disease's molecular mechanism. Most current approaches focus on constructing biological networks and utilizing machine learning, especially, deep learning to identify disease genes, but ignore the complex relations between entities in the biological knowledge graph. In this paper, we construct a biological knowledge graph centered on diseases and genes, and develop an end-to-end Knowledge graph completion model for Disease Gene Prediction using interactional tensor decomposition (called KDGene). KDGene introduces an interaction module between the embeddings of entities and relations to tensor decomposition, which can effectively enhance the information interaction in biological knowledge. Experimental results show that KDGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the comprehensive biological analysis of the case of diabetes mellitus confirms KDGene's ability for identifying new and accurate candidate genes. This work proposes a scalable knowledge graph completion framework to identify disease candidate genes, from which the results are promising to provide valuable references for further wet experiments.</p></details> |  |

A new nonlinear adaptive learning controller that is low-cost and portable to different wheelbase sizes is proposed to adapt to large-angle maneuvers and load changes in UAV delivery missions. The controller consists of a nonlinear variable gain (NLVG) function and an extreme value search (ES) algorithm to reduce overshoot and settling time. Finally, simulations were conducted on a quadcopter to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under two typical collision-free trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Egocentric Scene-aware Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19026v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable collaborative robots stand to assist human wearers who need fall prevention assistance or wear exoskeletons. Such a robot needs to be able to predict the ego motion of the wearer based on egocentric vision and the surrounding scene. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

| **[Can Language Beat Numerical Regression? Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

| **[UniTraj: A Unified Framework for Scalable Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15098v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction has increasingly relied on data-driven solutions, but their ability to scale to different data domains and the impact of larger dataset sizes on their generalization remain under-explored. While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict the lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[TC4D: Trajectory-Conditioned Text-to-4D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17920v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent techniques for text-to-4D generation synthesize dynamic 3D scenes using supervision from pre-trained text-to-video models. However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle: Learning the Angle-based Social Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05370v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians and cars in complex scenes has become more and more significant in many intelligent systems and applications. The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

Traditional methods rely on solving complex nonlinear programming problems, bringing significant delays in generating optimized trajectories. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to accelerate time-jerk optimal trajectory planning. Firstly, we introduce a dual-encoder based transformer model to establish a good preliminary trajectory. This trajectory is subsequently refined through sequential quadratic programming to improve its optimality and robustness. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 79.72\% in reducing trajectory planning time. Compared with existing methods, our method shrinks the optimality gap with the objective function value decreasing by up to 29.9\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spline Trajectory Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance for Mobile Agents via Convex Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16900v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an output feedback control-based motion planning technique for agents to enable them to converge to a specified polynomial trajectory while imposing a set of safety constraints on our controller to avoid collisions within the free configuration space (polygonal environment). To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAct Meets ActRe: Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories for Contrastive Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14589v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models. Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotation or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

| **[ProIn: Learning to Predict Trajectory Based on Progressive Interactions for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16374v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of pedestrians, cyclists, and other surrounding vehicles (all called agents) is very important for autonomous driving. Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

An accurate and robust trajectory tracking method is indispensable for these motion-related modules as a primitive routine. Current methods often make strong assumptions about the model such as the context and the dynamics, which are not robust enough to deal with the changing scenarios in a real-world system. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based trajectory tracking method for the motion-related modules in autonomous driving systems. The representation learning ability of DL and the exploration nature of RL bring strong robustness and improve accuracy. Meanwhile, it enhances versatility by running the trajectory tracking in a model-free and data-driven manner.

Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</p></details> |  |

While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potentials of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completely updated based on the reviews received for the paper</p></details> |

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines in producing physically realistic and precisely controllable vehicle trajectories. Additionally, it performs well in predicting unobservable physical variables in the latent space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, conference paper in motion generation</p></details> |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording through a two-stage process. In the first stage which is offline, we extract the trajectory of the demonstration. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. Subsequently, in the live online trajectory generation stage, we first \mbox{re-detect} all objects, then we warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene, and finally, we trace the trajectory with the robot. To complete these steps, our method makes leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Regularization Enhances Self-Supervised Geometric Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective in learning high-quality representations for various downstream tasks, with a primary focus on semantic tasks. However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored, partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised geometric representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation).

| **[A Physics Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15284v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.</p></details> |  |

While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel methodological framework for the analysis of health trajectories and survival outcomes in heart failure patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03138v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heart failure (HF) contributes to circa 200,000 annual hospitalizations in France. With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaDRE: Controllable and Diverse Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios using Real-World Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13208v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is an indispensable tool in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offering an efficient and safe alternative to road testing by allowing the exploration of a wide range of scenarios. Despite its advantages, a significant challenge within simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel generative framework, CaDRE, which is specifically designed for generating diverse and controllable safety-critical scenarios using real-world trajectories. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world data, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of flow matching methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the optimal transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristic minibatch OT approximations. To address this issue, we develop a novel optimal flow matching approach which recovers the straight OT displacement for the quadratic cost in just one flow matching step.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12861v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering dexterous robotic manipulation of deformable objects is vital for overcoming the limitations of parallel grippers in real-world applications. Current trajectory optimisation approaches often struggle to solve such tasks due to the large search space and the limited task information available from a cost function. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions in the play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory in the dataset. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then, D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a public benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin. We further demonstrate that trajectories found by D-Cubed readily transfer to a real-world LEAP hand on a folding task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://applied-ai-lab.github.io/D-cubed/</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).</p></details> |  |

The vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary initial position and orientation, the objective is to steer the system so that a given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal trajectory and establish that the optimal trajectory for the Dubins-laser system is one out of a total of 16 candidates. Finally, we provide numerical insights that illustrate the properties characterized in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Gain Disturbance Observer for Robust Trajectory Tracking of Quadrotors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19115v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple method to boost the robustness of quadrotors in trajectory tracking. The presented method features a high-gain disturbance observer (HGDO) that provides disturbance estimates in real-time. The estimates are then used in a trajectory control law to compensate for disturbance effects. We present theoretical convergence results showing that the proposed HGDO can quickly converge to an adjustable neighborhood of actual disturbance values. We will then integrate the disturbance estimates with a typical robust trajectory controller, namely sliding mode control (SMC), and present Lyapunov stability analysis to establish the boundedness of trajectory tracking errors. However, our stability analysis can be easily extended to other Lyapunov-based controllers to develop different HGDO-based controllers with formal stability guarantees. We evaluate the proposed HGDO-based control method using both simulation and laboratory experiments in various scenarios and in the presence of external disturbances. Our results indicate that the addition of HGDO to a quadrotor trajectory controller can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachability-based Trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit Neural Signed Distance Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12280v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating receding-horizon motion trajectories for autonomous vehicles in real-time while also providing safety guarantees is challenging. This is because a future trajectory needs to be planned before the previously computed trajectory is completely executed. This becomes even more difficult if the trajectory is required to satisfy continuous-time collision-avoidance constraints while accounting for a large number of obstacles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel real-time, receding-horizon motion planning algorithm named REachability-based trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit NEural signed Distance functions (REDEFINED). REDEFINED first applies offline reachability analysis to compute zonotope-based reachable sets that overapproximate the motion of the ego vehicle. During online planning, REDEFINED leverages zonotope arithmetic to construct a neural implicit representation that computes the exact signed distance between a parameterized swept volume of the ego vehicle and obstacle vehicles. REDEFINED then implements a novel, real-time optimization framework that utilizes the neural network to construct a collision avoidance constraint. REDEFINED is compared to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and is demonstrated to successfully enable the vehicle to safely navigate through complex environments. Code, data, and video demonstrations can be found at https://roahmlab.github.io/redefined/.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has shown that using such informative priors to regularize probabilistic deep learning (DL) models increases their performance and data-efficiency. However, commonly used sampling-based approximations for probabilistic DL models can be computationally expensive, requiring multiple inference passes and longer training times. Promising alternatives are compute-efficient last layer kernel approximations like spectral normalized Gaussian processes (SNGPs). We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method for SNGPs, which enables the use of informative priors that represent prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. Our proposal builds upon well-established methods and requires no rehearsal memory or parameter expansion. We apply our informed SNGP model to the trajectory prediction problem in autonomous driving by integrating prior drivability knowledge. On two public datasets, we investigate its performance under diminishing training data and across locations, and thereby demonstrate an increase in data-efficiency and robustness to location-transfers over non-informed and informed baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and Correlated Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11818v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) is to efficiently capture long-range spatial interactions over time from the video input. To address this challenge, we propose TCNet, a hybrid network that effectively models spatio-temporal information from Trajectories and Correlated regions. TCNet's trajectory module transforms frames into aligned trajectories composed of continuous visual tokens. In addition, for a query token, self-attention is learned along the trajectory. As such, our network can also focus on fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns, such as finger movements, of a specific region in motion. TCNet's correlation module uses a novel dynamic attention mechanism that filters out irrelevant frame regions. Additionally, it assigns dynamic key-value tokens from correlated regions to each query. Both innovations significantly reduce the computation cost and memory. We perform experiments on four large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL, and CSL-Daily, respectively. Our results demonstrate that TCNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, we improve over the previous state-of-the-art by 1.5% and 1.0% word error rate on PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14-T, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Generative models canbe used to augment real-world datasets with generated data toproduce edge case scenarios by sampling in a learned latentspace. Autoencoders can learn said latent representation for aspecific domain by learning to reconstruct the input data froma lower-dimensional intermediate representation. However, theresulting trajectories are not necessarily physically plausible, butinstead typically contain noise that is not present in the inputtrajectory. To resolve this issue, we propose the novel Physics-Informed Trajectory Autoencoder (PITA) architecture, whichincorporates a physical dynamics model into the loss functionof the autoencoder. This results in smooth trajectories that notonly reconstruct the input trajectory but also adhere to thephysical model. We evaluate PITA on a real-world dataset ofvehicle trajectories and compare its performance to a normalautoencoder and a state-of-the-art action-space autoencoder.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, enabling cars to anticipate the movements of surrounding objects for safe navigation. Trajectory prediction using Lidar point-cloud data performs better than 2D images due to providing 3D information. However, processing point-cloud data is more complicated and time-consuming than 2D images. Hence, state-of-the-art 3D trajectory predictions using point-cloud data suffer from slow and erroneous predictions. This paper introduces TrajectoryNAS, a pioneering method that focuses on utilizing point cloud data for trajectory prediction. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), TrajectoryNAS automates the design of trajectory prediction models, encompassing object detection, tracking, and forecasting in a cohesive manner. This approach not only addresses the complex interdependencies among these tasks but also emphasizes the importance of accuracy and efficiency in trajectory modeling. Through empirical studies, TrajectoryNAS demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant advancement in the field.Experimental results reveal that TrajcetoryNAS yield a minimum of 4.8 higger accuracy and 1.1* lower latency over competing methods on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Lossless Dataset Distillation via Difficulty-Aligned Trajectory Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05773v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ultimate goal of Dataset Distillation is to synthesize a small synthetic dataset such that a model trained on this synthetic set will perform equally well as a model trained on the full, real dataset. Until now, no method of Dataset Distillation has reached this completely lossless goal, in part due to the fact that previous methods only remain effective when the total number of synthetic samples is extremely small. Since only so much information can be contained in such a small number of samples, it seems that to achieve truly loss dataset distillation, we must develop a distillation method that remains effective as the size of the synthetic dataset grows. In this work, we present such an algorithm and elucidate why existing methods fail to generate larger, high-quality synthetic sets. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on trajectory-matching, or optimizing the synthetic data to induce similar long-term training dynamics as the real data. We empirically find that the training stage of the trajectories we choose to match (i.e., early or late) greatly affects the effectiveness of the distilled dataset. Specifically, early trajectories (where the teacher network learns easy patterns) work well for a low-cardinality synthetic set since there are fewer examples wherein to distribute the necessary information. Conversely, late trajectories (where the teacher network learns hard patterns) provide better signals for larger synthetic sets since there are now enough samples to represent the necessary complex patterns. Based on our findings, we propose to align the difficulty of the generated patterns with the size of the synthetic dataset. In doing so, we successfully scale trajectory matching-based methods to larger synthetic datasets, achieving lossless dataset distillation for the very first time. Code and distilled datasets are available at https://gzyaftermath.github.io/DATM.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First lossless dataset distillation method, accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, a diffusion-based generative model for multi-agent trajectory prediction is proposed. The model is capable of capturing the complex interactions between traffic participants and the environment, accurately learning the multimodal nature of the data. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed on large-scale datasets of real-world traffic scenarios, showing that our model outperforms several well-established methods in terms of prediction accuracy. By the incorporation of differential motion constraints on the model output, we illustrate that our model is capable of generating a diverse set of realistic future trajectories. Through the use of an interaction-aware guidance signal, we further demonstrate that the model can be adapted to predict the behavior of less cooperative agents, emphasizing its practical applicability under uncertain traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uniquely integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraints information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This "gray box" method marries the optimization-based safety and interpretability with the powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and on the real robot. In simulation, LeTO achieves a success rate comparable to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, but the generated trajectories are of less uncertainty, higher quality, and smoother. In real-world experiments, we deployed LeTO to handle constraints-critical tasks. The results show the effectiveness of LeTO comparing with state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods often model the transition function as a differential equation or as a recurrent neural network. Despite their effectiveness in predicting future measurements, few results have successfully established a method for sampling and statistical inference of trajectories using neural networks, partially due to constraints in the parameterization. In this work, we introduce a mechanism to learn the distribution of trajectories by parameterizing the transition function $f$ explicitly as an element in a function space. Our framework allows efficient synthesis of novel trajectories, while also directly providing a convenient tool for inference, i.e., uncertainty estimation, likelihood evaluations and out of distribution detection for abnormal trajectories. These capabilities can have implications for various downstream tasks, e.g., simulation and evaluation for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pioneering SE(2)-Equivariant Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11304v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning the trajectory of the controlled ego vehicle is a key challenge in automated driving. As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods utilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the scene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory planning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under roto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a lightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint predictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The equivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output stability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route attraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an off-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from embedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the equivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without forcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner. The results show that the planned trajectory is stable under roto-translations of the input scene which demonstrates the equivariance of our model. Despite using only a small split of the dataset for training, our method improves L2 distance at 3 s by 20.6 % and surpasses the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Graph Search and Trajectory Optimization for Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08948v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints. However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use. Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Efficient Trajectory Forecasting and Generation with Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10809v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and generation are vital for autonomous robots navigating dynamic environments. While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Diffusion models, which are currently state-of-the-art for learned trajectory generation in long-horizon planning and offline reinforcement learning tasks, rely on a computationally intensive iterative sampling process. This slow process impedes the dynamic capabilities of robotic systems. In contrast, we introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel data-driven approach that utilizes flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient and fast trajectory generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-CFM on three separate tasks: adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an increase of 35% in predictive accuracy and 142% increase in planning performance. Notably, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion-based models without sacrificing accuracy, which is crucial for real-time decision making in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[iDb-RRT: Sampling-based Kinodynamic Motion Planning with Motion Primitives and Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10745v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and its variations have emerged as a robust and efficient tool for finding collision-free paths in robotic systems. However, adding dynamic constraints makes the motion planning problem significantly harder, as it requires solving two-value boundary problems (computationally expensive) or propagating random control inputs (uninformative). Alternatively, Iterative Discontinuity Bounded A* (iDb-A*), introduced in our previous study, combines search and optimization iteratively. The search step connects short trajectories (motion primitives) while allowing a bounded discontinuity between the motion primitives, which is later repaired in the trajectory optimization step. Building upon these foundations, in this paper, we present iDb-RRT, a sampling-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that combines motion primitives and trajectory optimization within the RRT framework. iDb-RRT is probabilistically complete and can be implemented in forward or bidirectional mode. We have tested our algorithm across a benchmark suite comprising 30 problems, spanning 8 different systems, and shown that iDb-RRT can find solutions up to 10x faster than previous methods, especially in complex scenarios that require long trajectories or involve navigating through narrow passages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

Algorithms with temporal robustness are crucial in guaranteeing the successful execution of tasks and missions in such scenarios. We study time-robust path planning for synthesizing robots' trajectories that adhere to spatial-temporal specifications expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In contrast to prior approaches that rely on {discretize}d trajectories with fixed time steps, we leverage Piece-Wise Linear (PWL) signals for the synthesis. PWL signals represent a trajectory through a sequence of time-stamped waypoints. This allows us to encode the STL formula into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) with fewer variables. This reduction is more pronounced for specifications with a long planning horizon. To that end, we define time-robustness for PWL signals. Subsequently, we propose quantitative semantics for PWL signals according to the recursive syntax of STL and prove their soundness. We then propose an encoding strategy to transform our semantics into a MILP. Our simulations showcase the soundness and the performance of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> |  |

One of the challenges is that the motion capabilities of the quadruped robot are anisotropic along different directions, which significantly affects the safety of quadruped robot navigation. This paper proposes a navigation framework that takes into account the motion anisotropy of quadruped robots including kinodynamic trajectory generation, nonlinear trajectory optimization, and nonlinear model predictive control. In simulation and real robot tests, we demonstrate that our motion-anisotropy-aware navigation framework could: (1) generate more efficient trajectories and realize more agile quadruped navigation; (2) significantly improve the navigation safety in challenging scenarios.

While data-driven approaches have been used to address this complex problem, they suffer from unreliable predictions under distribution shifts during test time. Accordingly, several online learning methods have been proposed using regression loss from the ground truth of observed data leveraging the auto-labeling nature of trajectory prediction task. We mainly tackle the following two issues. First, previous works underfit and overfit as they only optimize the last layer of the motion decoder. To this end, we employ the masked autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning to encourage complex interaction modeling in shifted test distribution for updating deeper layers. Second, utilizing the sequential nature of driving data, we propose an actor-specific token memory that enables the test-time learning of actor-wise motion characteristics. Our proposed method has been validated across various challenging cross-dataset distribution shift scenarios including nuScenes, Lyft, Waymo, and Interaction. Our method surpasses the performance of existing state-of-the-art online learning methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

| **[Predictive Clustering of Vessel Behavior Based on Hierarchical Trajectory Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08838v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel trajectory clustering, which aims to find similar trajectory patterns, has been widely leveraged in overwater applications. Most traditional methods use predefined rules and thresholds to identify discrete vessel behaviors. They aim for high-quality clustering and conduct clustering on entire sequences, whether the original trajectory or its sub-trajectories, failing to represent their evolution. To resolve this problem, we propose a Predictive Clustering of Hierarchical Vessel Behavior (PC-HiV). PC-HiV first uses hierarchical representations to transform every trajectory into a behavioral sequence. Then, it predicts evolution at each timestamp of the sequence based on the representations. By applying predictive clustering and latent encoding, PC-HiV improves clustering and predictions simultaneously. Experiments on real AIS datasets demonstrate PC-HiV's superiority over existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing behavioral evolution discrepancies between vessel types (tramp vs. liner) and within emission control areas. Results show that our method outperforms NN-Kmeans and Robust DAA by 3.9% and 6.4% of the purity score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-aware Denoising Diffusion Model for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09190v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving, particularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent uncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to produce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of them suffer from restricted representation ability or unstable training issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to generate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled to realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with the uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize. Second, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase, rendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose an Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which tackles the above two problems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and action uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To decrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the intention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the action-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with an FDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on the ETH/UCY dataset. Compared with the original diffusion model, IDM reduces inference time by two-thirds. Interestingly, our experiments further reveal that introducing intention information is beneficial in modeling the diffusion process of fewer steps.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[APACE: Agile and Perception-Aware Trajectory Generation for Quadrotor Flights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08365v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various perception-aware planning approaches have attempted to enhance the state estimation accuracy during maneuvers, while the feature matchability among frames, a crucial factor influencing estimation accuracy, has often been overlooked. In this paper, we present APACE, an Agile and Perception-Aware trajeCtory gEneration framework for quadrotors aggressive flight, that takes into account feature matchability during trajectory planning. We seek to generate a perception-aware trajectory that reduces the error of visual-based estimator while satisfying the constraints on smoothness, safety, agility and the quadrotor dynamics. The perception objective is achieved by maximizing the number of covisible features while ensuring small enough parallax angles. Additionally, we propose a differentiable and accurate visibility model that allows decomposition of the trajectory planning problem for efficient optimization resolution. Through validations conducted in both a photorealistic simulator and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the trajectories generated by our method significantly improve state estimation accuracy, with root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by up to an order of magnitude. The source code will be released to benefit the community.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2024 |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02279v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency Models (CM) (Song et al., 2023) accelerate score-based diffusion model sampling at the cost of sample quality but lack a natural way to trade-off quality for speed. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

However, existing pedestrian trajectory prediction methods still need more exploration to fully leverage these motion patterns. This paper investigates the possibilities of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction tasks by inducing motion cues. We introduce LG-Traj, a novel approach incorporating LLMs to generate motion cues present in pedestrian past/observed trajectories. Our approach also incorporates motion cues present in pedestrian future trajectories by clustering future trajectories of training data using a mixture of Gaussians. These motion cues, along with pedestrian coordinates, facilitate a better understanding of the underlying representation. Furthermore, we utilize singular value decomposition to augment the observed trajectories, incorporating them into the model learning process to further enhance representation learning. Our method employs a transformer-based architecture comprising a motion encoder to model motion patterns and a social decoder to capture social interactions among pedestrians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on popular pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmarks, namely ETH-UCY and SDD, and present various ablation experiments to validate our approach.</p></details> | Under Review |

Stratifying AKI patients into groups based on severity and duration would facilitate more targeted efforts for treating AKI. Methods: In a retrospective, multicenter and longitudinal cohort study of 935,679 patients who were admitted between 2012 and 2020 to health centers included in OneFlorida+ Network, we analyzed the impact of AKI trajectories which are rapidly reversed AKI, persistent AKI with renal recovery, and persistent AKI without renal recovery on patients' clinical outcomes, including hospital, 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, kidney replacement therapy, new chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 90 days or 1-year of discharge, CKD progression within 1-year of discharge, resource utilization, hospital disposition, and major complications during hospitalization. As analytical approaches, Kaplan-Meier estimators and survival curves, Cox proportional-hazards regression model, logistic regression model, Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance, chi-square, Fisher's exact test were used. Results: Among 2,187,254 encounters, 14% had AKI, of which 63%, 21%, and 16% had Stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively, as the worst AKI stage. Fraction of patients with persistent AKI was 31%. Patients with AKI had worse clinical outcomes and increased resource utilization compared to patients without the condition. One-year mortality was 5 times greater for patients with persistent AKI compared to those without AKI. Conclusions: Persistent AKI was associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased ICU admission and mortality compared to the other groups. This may emphasize the critical need for devising strategies targeting effective management of AKI and prevention of persisting AKI.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures, 13 supplemental tables, 3 supplemental figures</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case that the obstacles and goal are near each other. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. With PARC, the main source of conservativeness is the model mismatch, which can be mitigated by careful controller and planning model design. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Given the constraint of limited resources, it is essential to leverage existing computational work (e.g., learned policies, samples) to enhance sample efficiency and reduce the computational resource consumption of DRL algorithms. Previous works to leverage existing computational work require intrusive modifications to existing algorithms and models, designed specifically for specific algorithms, lacking flexibility and universality. In this paper, we present the Snapshot Reinforcement Learning (SnapshotRL) framework, which enhances sample efficiency by simply altering environments, without making any modifications to algorithms and models. By allowing student agents to choose states in teacher trajectories as the initial state to sample, SnapshotRL can effectively utilize teacher trajectories to assist student agents in training, allowing student agents to explore a larger state space at the early training phase. We propose a simple and effective SnapshotRL baseline algorithm, S3RL, which integrates well with existing DRL algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating S3RL with TD3, SAC, and PPO algorithms on the MuJoCo benchmark significantly improves sample efficiency and average return, without extra samples and additional computational resources.</p></details> | Under review |

However, planning trajectories for AGVs in obstacle-dense, unstructured environments presents significant challenges due to the nonholonomic kinematics, abundant obstacles, and the scenario's nonconvex and constrained nature. To address this, we propose an efficient trajectory planning framework for AGVs by formulating the problem as an optimal control problem. Our framework utilizes the fast safe rectangular corridor (FSRC) algorithm to construct rectangular convex corridors, representing avoidance constraints as box constraints. This eliminates redundant obstacle influences and accelerates the solution speed. Additionally, we employ the Modified Visibility Graph algorithm to speed up path planning and a boundary discretization strategy to expedite FSRC construction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, particularly in computational efficiency. Compared to advanced frameworks, our framework achieves computational efficiency gains of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Notably, FSRC significantly outperforms other safe convex corridor-based methods regarding computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |

Towards this end, we introduce some natural notions of the complexity of optimization trajectories, both qualitative and quantitative, which reveal the inherent nuance and interplay involved between various optimization choices, such as momentum, weight decay, and batch size. We use them to provide key hallmarks about the nature of optimization in deep neural networks: when it goes right, and when it finds itself in a dead end. Further, thanks to our trajectory perspective, we uncover an intertwined behaviour of momentum and weight decay that promotes directional exploration, as well as a directional regularization behaviour of some others. We perform experiments over large-scale vision and language settings, including large language models (LLMs) with up to 12 billion parameters, to demonstrate the value of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint, 51 pages |

However, in mobile robot trajectory tracking, many recent works still naively utilize optimization methods for elements in vector space without considering the manifold constraint of the robot configuration. In this letter, we propose a geometric model predictive control (MPC) framework for wheeled mobile robot trajectory tracking. We first derive the error dynamics of the wheeled mobile robot trajectory tracking by considering its manifold constraint and kinematic constraint simultaneously. After that, we utilize the relationship between the Lie group and Lie algebra to convexify the tracking control problem, which enables us to solve the problem efficiently. Thanks to the Lie group formulation, our method tracks the trajectory more smoothly than existing nonlinear MPC. Simulations and physical experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Our pure Python-based simulation platform is publicly available to benefit further research in the community.</p></details> |  |

Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PETS'24 Issue 3.

Accurately forecasting CTh trajectories can significantly enhance early diagnosis and intervention strategies, providing timely care. However, the longitudinal data essential for these studies often suffer from temporal sparsity and incompleteness, presenting substantial challenges in modeling the disease's progression accurately. Existing methods are limited, focusing primarily on datasets without missing entries or requiring predefined assumptions about CTh progression. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a conditional score-based diffusion model specifically designed to generate CTh trajectories with the given baseline information, such as age, sex, and initial diagnosis. Our conditional diffusion model utilizes all available data during the training phase to make predictions based solely on baseline information during inference without needing prior history about CTh progression. The prediction accuracy of the proposed CTh prediction pipeline using a conditional score-based model was compared for sub-groups consisting of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD subjects. The Bland-Altman analysis shows our diffusion-based prediction model has a near-zero bias with narrow 95% confidential interval compared to the ground-truth CTh in 6-36 months. In addition, our conditional diffusion model has a stochastic generative nature, therefore, we demonstrated an uncertainty analysis of patient-specific CTh prediction through multiple realizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Guided Abnormal Trajectory Gap Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06268v1)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectories with gaps (i.e., missing data), we investigate algorithms to identify abnormal gaps in trajectories which occur when a given moving object did not report its location, but other moving objects in the same geographic region periodically did. The problem is important due to its societal applications, such as improving maritime safety and regulatory enforcement for global security concerns such as illegal fishing, illegal oil transfers, and trans-shipments. The problem is challenging due to the difficulty of bounding the possible locations of the moving object during a trajectory gap, and the very high computational cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data. The current literature on anomalous trajectory detection assumes linear interpolation within gaps, which may not be able to detect abnormal gaps since objects within a given region may have traveled away from their shortest path. In preliminary work, we introduced an abnormal gap measure that uses a classical space-time prism model to bound an object's possible movement during the trajectory gap and provided a scalable memoized gap detection algorithm (Memo-AGD). In this paper, we propose a Space Time-Aware Gap Detection (STAGD) approach to leverage space-time indexing and merging of trajectory gaps. We also incorporate a Dynamic Region Merge-based (DRM) approach to efficiently compute gap abnormality scores. We provide theoretical proofs that both algorithms are correct and complete and also provide analysis of asymptotic time complexity. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world maritime trajectory data show that the proposed approach substantially improves computation time over the baseline technique.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARPLS: A Feature-Augmented Robot Trajectory Preference Labeling System to Assist Human Labelers' Preference Elicitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06267v1)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based learning aims to align robot task objectives with human values. One of the most common methods to infer human preferences is by pairwise comparisons of robot task trajectories. Traditional comparison-based preference labeling systems seldom support labelers to digest and identify critical differences between complex trajectories recorded in videos. Our formative study (N = 12) suggests that individuals may overlook non-salient task features and establish biased preference criteria during their preference elicitation process because of partial observations. In addition, they may experience mental fatigue when given many pairs to compare, causing their label quality to deteriorate. To mitigate these issues, we propose FARPLS, a Feature-Augmented Robot trajectory Preference Labeling System. FARPLS highlights potential outliers in a wide variety of task features that matter to humans and extracts the corresponding video keyframes for easy review and comparison. It also dynamically adjusts the labeling order according to users' familiarities, difficulties of the trajectory pair, and level of disagreements. At the same time, the system monitors labelers' consistency and provides feedback on labeling progress to keep labelers engaged. A between-subjects study (N = 42, 105 pairs of robot pick-and-place trajectories per person) shows that FARPLS can help users establish preference criteria more easily and notice more relevant details in the presented trajectories than the conventional interface. FARPLS also improves labeling consistency and engagement, mitigating challenges in preference elicitation without raising cognitive loads significantly</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) 2024, March 18-21, 2024, Greenville, SC, USA</p></details> |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to re-plan folding trajectory at every time-step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from visual-language models. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories to cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

Discover the Power of Zero-Shot Trajectory Tracing with LLMs!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06201v1)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a burgeoning discussion around the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in acting as fundamental components that can be seamlessly incorporated into Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) to interpret complex trajectories. This study introduces LLMTrack, a model that illustrates how LLMs can be leveraged for Zero-Shot Trajectory Recognition by employing a novel single-prompt technique that combines role-play and think step-by-step methodologies with unprocessed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. We evaluate the model using real-world datasets designed to challenge it with distinct trajectories characterized by indoor and outdoor scenarios. In both test scenarios, LLMTrack not only meets but exceeds the performance benchmarks set by traditional machine learning approaches and even contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning models, all without the requirement of training on specialized datasets. The results of our research suggest that, with strategically designed prompts, LLMs can tap into their extensive knowledge base and are well-equipped to analyze raw sensor data with remarkable effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

Recent work utilizing prominent deep learning models for pedestrian motion prediction makes limited a priori assumptions about human movements, resulting in a lack of explainability and explicit constraints enforced on predicted trajectories. We present a dynamics-based deep learning framework with a novel asymptotically stable dynamical system integrated into a Transformer-based model. We use an asymptotically stable dynamical system to model human goal-targeted motion by enforcing the human walking trajectory, which converges to a predicted goal position, and to provide the Transformer model with prior knowledge and explainability. Our framework features the Transformer model that works with a goal estimator and dynamical system to learn features from pedestrian motion history. The results show that our framework outperforms prominent models using five benchmark human motion datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (including references), 7 figures, accepted by ICRA2024</p></details> |

However, collecting massive and annotated real-world human datasets has been a laborious task, especially for highly interactive scenarios. On the other hand, algorithmic data generation methods are usually limited by their model capacities, making them unable to offer realistic and diverse data needed by various application users. In this work, we study trajectory-level data generation for multi-human or human-robot interaction scenarios and propose a learning-based automatic trajectory generation model, which we call Multi-Agent TRajectory generation with dIverse conteXts (MATRIX). MATRIX is capable of generating interactive human behaviors in realistic diverse contexts. We achieve this goal by modeling the explicit and interpretable objectives so that MATRIX can generate human motions based on diverse destinations and heterogeneous behaviors. We carried out extensive comparison and ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach across various metrics. We also presented experiments that demonstrate the capability of MATRIX to serve as data augmentation for imitation-based motion planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |

We extend recent sampling-based approaches that leverage controlled stochastic processes to model approximate samples from these target densities. The main drawback of these approaches is that the training objective requires full trajectories to compute, resulting in sluggish credit assignment issues due to use of entire trajectories and a learning signal present only at the terminal time. In this work, we present Diffusion Generative Flow Samplers (DGFS), a sampling-based framework where the learning process can be tractably broken down into short partial trajectory segments, via parameterizing an additional "flow function". Our method takes inspiration from the theory developed for generative flow networks (GFlowNets), allowing us to make use of intermediate learning signals. Through various challenging experiments, we demonstrate that DGFS achieves more accurate estimates of the normalization constant than closely-related prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

A common tacit assumption is the KGE entity similarity assumption, which states that these KGEMs retain the graph's structure within their embedding space, \textit{i.e.}, position similar entities within the graph close to one another. This desirable property make KGEMs widely used in downstream tasks such as recommender systems or drug repurposing. Yet, the relation of entity similarity and similarity in the embedding space has rarely been formally evaluated. Typically, KGEMs are assessed based on their sole link prediction capabilities, using ranked-based metrics such as Hits@K or Mean Rank. This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that entity similarity in the graph is inherently mirrored in the embedding space. Therefore, we conduct extensive experiments to measure the capability of KGEMs to cluster similar entities together, and investigate the nature of the underlying factors. Moreover, we study if different KGEMs expose a different notion of similarity. Datasets, pre-trained embeddings and code are available at: https://github.com/nicolas-hbt/similar-embeddings/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESWC 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we study leveraging knowledge graph embeddings to improve the effectiveness of PEFT. We propose a knowledgeable adaptation method called KnowLA. It inserts an adaptation layer into an LLM to integrate the embeddings of entities appearing in the input text. The adaptation layer is trained in combination with LoRA on instruction data. Experiments on six benchmarks with two popular LLMs and three knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of KnowLA.

| **[Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization with Multi-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14733v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of large open knowledge bases (OKBs) is integral to many knowledge-driven applications on the world wide web such as web search. However, noun phrases and relational phrases in OKBs often suffer from redundancy and ambiguity, which calls for the investigation on OKB canonicalization. Current solutions address OKB canonicalization by devising advanced clustering algorithms and using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to further facilitate the canonicalization process. Nevertheless, these works fail to fully exploit the synergy between clustering and KGE learning, and the methods designed for these subtasks are sub-optimal. To this end, we put forward a multi-task learning framework, namely MulCanon, to tackle OKB canonicalization. In addition, diffusion model is used in the soft clustering process to improve the noun phrase representations with neighboring information, which can lead to more accurate representations. MulCanon unifies the learning objectives of these sub-tasks, and adopts a two-stage multi-task learning paradigm for training. A thorough experimental study on popular OKB canonicalization benchmarks validates that MulCanon can achieve competitive canonicalization results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.16419</p></details> |

In this paper, we link knowledge graph completion and counterfactual reasoning via our new task CFKGR. We model the original world state as a knowledge graph, hypothetical scenarios as edges added to the graph, and plausible changes to the graph as inferences from logical rules. We create corresponding benchmark datasets, which contain diverse hypothetical scenarios with plausible changes to the original knowledge graph and facts that should be retained. We develop COULDD, a general method for adapting existing knowledge graph embeddings given a hypothetical premise, and evaluate it on our benchmark. Our results indicate that KGEs learn patterns in the graph without explicit training. We further observe that KGEs adapted with COULDD solidly detect plausible counterfactual changes to the graph that follow these patterns. An evaluation on human-annotated data reveals that KGEs adapted with COULDD are mostly unable to recognize changes to the graph that do not follow learned inference rules. In contrast, ChatGPT mostly outperforms KGEs in detecting plausible changes to the graph but has poor knowledge retention. In summary, CFKGR connects two previously distinct areas, namely KG completion and counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2024</p></details> |

Different from the previous translation-based models, TransERR encodes knowledge graphs in the hypercomplex-valued space, thus enabling it to possess a higher degree of translation freedom in mining latent information between the head and tail entities. To further minimize the translation distance, TransERR adaptively rotates the head entity and the tail entity with their corresponding unit quaternions, which are learnable in model training. We also provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TransERR in modeling various relation patterns, including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition, and subrelation patterns. The experiments on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and the generalization of TransERR. The results also indicate that TransERR can better encode large-scale datasets with fewer parameters than the previous translation-based models.

These optimal features typically depend on tunable parameters of the lower-level energy in such a way that the entire bilevel pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Although not generally presented as such, this paper demonstrates how a variety of graph learning techniques can be recast as special cases of bilevel optimization or simplifications thereof. In brief, building on prior work we first derive a more flexible class of energy functions that, when paired with various descent steps (e.g., gradient descent, proximal methods, momentum, etc.), form graph neural network (GNN) message-passing layers; critically, we also carefully unpack where any residual approximation error lies with respect to the underlying constituent message-passing functions. We then probe several simplifications of this framework to derive close connections with non-GNN-based graph learning approaches, including knowledge graph embeddings, various forms of label propagation, and efficient graph-regularized MLP models. And finally, we present supporting empirical results that demonstrate the versatility of the proposed bilevel lens, which we refer to as BloomGML, referencing that BiLevel Optimization Offers More Graph Machine Learning.

They are trained with loss functions that consider batches of true and false triples. However, different kinds of false triples exist and recent works suggest that they should not be valued equally, leading to specific negative sampling procedures. In line with this recent assumption, we posit that negative triples that are semantically valid w.r.t. signatures of relations (domain and range) are high-quality negatives. Hence, we enrich the three main loss functions for link prediction such that all kinds of negatives are sampled but treated differently based on their semantic validity. In an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed loss functions systematically provide satisfying results which demonstrates both the generality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss functions (1) lead to better MRR and Hits@10 values, and (2) drive KGEMs towards better semantic correctness as measured by the Sem@K metric. This highlights that relation signatures globally improve KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions. Domains and ranges of relations being largely available in schema-defined KGs, this makes our approach both beneficial and widely usable in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ESWC 2024</p></details> |

Embedding-based methods have shown effectiveness in addressing this problem by modeling relational patterns in triples. However, the link prediction task often requires contextual information in entity neighborhoods, while most existing embedding-based methods fail to capture it. Additionally, little attention is paid to the diversity of entity representations in different contexts, which often leads to false prediction results. In this situation, we consider that the schema of knowledge graph contains the specific contextual information, and it is beneficial for preserving the consistency of entities across contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel Schema-augmented Multi-level contrastive LEarning framework (SMiLE) to conduct knowledge graph link prediction. Specifically, we first exploit network schema as the prior constraint to sample negatives and pre-train our model by employing a multi-level contrastive learning method to yield both prior schema and contextual information. Then we fine-tune our model under the supervision of individual triples to learn subtler representations for link prediction. Extensive experimental results on four knowledge graph datasets with thorough analysis of each component demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework against state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of SMiLE is available at https://github.com/GKNL/SMiLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2022</p></details> |

These models aim to encode entities and relations present in a knowledge graph into a lower-dimensional vector space. During the training process of KGE models, using positive and negative samples becomes essential for discrimination purposes. However, obtaining negative samples directly from existing knowledge graphs poses a challenge, emphasizing the need for effective generation techniques. The quality of these negative samples greatly impacts the accuracy of the learned embeddings, making their generation a critical aspect of KGRL. This comprehensive survey paper systematically reviews various negative sampling (NS) methods and their contributions to the success of KGRL. Their respective advantages and disadvantages are outlined by categorizing existing NS methods into five distinct categories. Moreover, this survey identifies open research questions that serve as potential directions for future investigations. By offering a generalization and alignment of fundamental NS concepts, this survey provides valuable insights for designing effective NS methods in the context of KGRL and serves as a motivating force for further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |

The ability to perform complex logical reasoning is essential and supports various graph reasoning-based downstream tasks, such as search engines. Recent approaches are proposed to represent KG entities and logical queries into embedding vectors and find answers to logical queries from the KGs. However, existing proposed methods mainly focus on querying a single KG and cannot be applied to multiple graphs. In addition, directly sharing KGs with sensitive information may incur privacy risks, making it impractical to share and construct an aggregated KG for reasoning to retrieve query answers. Thus, it remains unknown how to answer queries on multi-source KGs. An entity can be involved in various knowledge graphs and reasoning on multiple KGs and answering complex queries on multi-source KGs is important in discovering knowledge cross graphs. Fortunately, federated learning is utilized in knowledge graphs to collaboratively learn representations with privacy preserved. Federated knowledge graph embeddings enrich the relations in knowledge graphs to improve the representation quality. However, these methods only focus on one-hop relations and cannot perform complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we apply federated learning to complex query-answering tasks to reason over multi-source knowledge graphs while preserving privacy. We propose a Federated Complex Query Answering framework (FedCQA), to reason over multi-source KGs avoiding sensitive raw data transmission to protect privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and evaluate retrieval performance on various types of complex queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction in Low Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13704v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been validated as powerful methods for inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KGs) that they typically map entities into Euclidean space and treat relations as transformations of entities. Recently, some Euclidean KGE methods have been enhanced to model semantic hierarchies commonly found in KGs, improving the performance of link prediction. To embed hierarchical data, hyperbolic space has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Euclidean space, offering high fidelity and lower memory consumption. Unlike Euclidean, hyperbolic space provides countless curvatures to choose from. However, it is difficult for existing hyperbolic KGE methods to obtain the optimal curvature settings manually, thereby limiting their ability to effectively model semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel KGE model called $\textbf{Hyp}$erbolic $\textbf{H}$ierarchical $\textbf{KGE}$ (HypHKGE). This model introduces attention-based learnable curvatures for hyperbolic space, which helps preserve rich semantic hierarchies. Furthermore, to utilize the preserved hierarchies for inferring missing links, we define hyperbolic hierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, including both inter-level and intra-level modeling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HypHKGE model on the three benchmark datasets (WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10). The source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wjzheng96/HypHKGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[EntailE: Introducing Textual Entailment in Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09666v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonsense knowledge graph completion is a new challenge for commonsense knowledge graph construction and application. In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Despite these successes, a significant gap persists between generative models and the utilization of extensive biomedical knowledge, often systematized within knowledge graphs, whose potential to inform and enhance generative processes has not been realized. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges this divide by developing a framework for knowledge-enhanced generative models called K-DReAM. We develop a scalable methodology to extend the functionality of knowledge graphs while preserving semantic integrity and incorporate this contextual information into a generative framework to guide a diffusion-based model. The integration of knowledge graph embeddings with our generative model furnishes a robust mechanism for producing novel drug candidates possessing specific characteristics while ensuring validity and synthesizability. K-DReAM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on both unconditional and targeted generation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages |

These platforms, however, often feature posts as brief texts, posing challenges for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in understanding context. We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining community-maintained knowledge graphs (like Wikidata) with deep learning to enhance the categorization of social media posts. This method uses advanced entity recognizers and linkers (like Falcon 2.0) to connect short post entities to knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextualized word embeddings (like BERT) are then employed to create rich, context-based representations of these posts. Our focus is on the health domain, particularly in identifying posts related to eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia) to aid healthcare providers in early diagnosis. We tested our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders, finding that merging word embeddings with knowledge graph information enhances the predictive models' reliability. This methodology aims to assist health experts in spotting patterns indicative of mental disorders, thereby improving early detection and accurate diagnosis for personalized medicine.</p></details> |  |

Despite the superior performance of KGE models in practice, we discover a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular existing KGE models called \emph{Z-paradox}. Motivated by the existence of Z-paradox, we propose a new KGE model called \emph{MQuinE} that does not suffer from Z-paradox while preserves strong expressiveness to model various relation patterns including symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and composition relations with theoretical justification. Experiments on real-world knowledge bases indicate that Z-paradox indeed degrades the performance of existing KGE models, and can cause more than 20\% accuracy drop on some challenging test samples. Our experiments further demonstrate that MQuinE can mitigate the negative impact of Z-paradox and outperform existing KGE models by a visible margin on link prediction tasks.</p></details> | 18pages, 1 figure |
| **[Embedding Knowledge Graphs in Degenerate Clifford Algebras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04870v1)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clifford algebras are a natural generalization of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge in achieving better KG embeddings lies in capturing relation patterns, including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, commutative composition, non-commutative composition, hierarchy, and multiplicity. This study introduces a novel model called 3H-TH (3D Rotation and Translation in Hyperbolic space) that captures these relation patterns simultaneously. In contrast, previous attempts have not achieved satisfactory performance across all the mentioned properties at the same time. The experimental results demonstrate that the new model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, hierarchy property, and other relation patterns in low-dimensional space, meanwhile performing similarly in high-dimensional space.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, EACL2024 main</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Knowledge Graphs and Rules with Octagon Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16270v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Region based knowledge graph embeddings represent relations as geometric regions. This has the advantage that the rules which are captured by the model are made explicit, making it straightforward to incorporate prior knowledge and to inspect learned models. Unfortunately, existing approaches are severely restricted in their ability to model relational composition, and hence also their ability to model rules, thus failing to deliver on the main promise of region based models. With the aim of addressing these limitations, we investigate regions which are composed of axis-aligned octagons. Such octagons are particularly easy to work with, as intersections and compositions can be straightforwardly computed, while they are still sufficiently expressive to model arbitrary knowledge graphs. Among others, we also show that our octagon embeddings can properly capture a non-trivial class of rule bases. Finally, we show that our model achieves competitive experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training and Diagnosing Knowledge Base Completion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15439v1)** | 2024-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce and analyze an approach to knowledge transfer from one collection of facts to another without the need for entity or relation matching. The method works for both canonicalized knowledge bases and uncanonicalized or open knowledge bases, i.e., knowledge bases where more than one copy of a real-world entity or relation may exist. The main contribution is a method that can make use of large-scale pre-training on facts, which were collected from unstructured text, to improve predictions on structured data from a specific domain. The introduced method is most impactful on small datasets such as ReVerb20k, where a 6% absolute increase of mean reciprocal rank and 65% relative decrease of mean rank over the previously best method was achieved, despite not relying on large pre-trained models like Bert. To understand the obtained pre-trained models better, we then introduce a novel dataset for the analysis of pre-trained models for Open Knowledge Base Completion, called Doge (Diagnostics of Open knowledge Graph Embeddings). It consists of 6 subsets and is designed to measure multiple properties of a pre-trained model: robustness against synonyms, ability to perform deductive reasoning, presence of gender stereotypes, consistency with reverse relations, and coverage of different areas of general knowledge. Using the introduced dataset, we show that the existing OKBC models lack consistency in the presence of synonyms and inverse relations and are unable to perform deductive reasoning. Moreover, their predictions often align with gender stereotypes, which persist even when presented with counterevidence. We additionally investigate the role of pre-trained word embeddings and demonstrate that avoiding biased word embeddings is not a sufficient measure to prevent biased behavior of OKBC models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIJ, reference to follow. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2108.13073</p></details> |
| **[How to Turn Your Knowledge Graph Embeddings into Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15944v3)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some of the most successful knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models for link prediction -- CP, RESCAL, TuckER, ComplEx -- can be interpreted as energy-based models. Under this perspective they are not amenable for exact maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), sampling and struggle to integrate logical constraints. This work re-interprets the score functions of these KGEs as circuits -- constrained computational graphs allowing efficient marginalisation. Then, we design two recipes to obtain efficient generative circuit models by either restricting their activations to be non-negative or squaring their outputs. Our interpretation comes with little or no loss of performance for link prediction, while the circuits framework unlocks exact learning by MLE, efficient sampling of new triples, and guarantee that logical constraints are satisfied by design. Furthermore, our models scale more gracefully than the original KGEs on graphs with millions of entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-Enabled Anomaly Detection and Information Completion for Social Network Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07022v1)** | 2024-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly advancing information era, various human behaviors are being precisely recorded in the form of data, including identity information, criminal records, and communication data. Law enforcement agencies can effectively maintain social security and precisely combat criminal activities by analyzing the aforementioned data. In comparison to traditional data analysis methods, deep learning models, relying on the robust computational power in cloud centers, exhibit higher accuracy in extracting data features and inferring data. However, within the architecture of cloud centers, the transmission of data from end devices introduces significant latency, hindering real-time inference of data. Furthermore, low-latency edge computing architectures face limitations in direct deployment due to relatively weak computing and storage capacities of nodes. To address these challenges, a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture that utilizes knowledge graph embedding for data analysis. Subsequently, to filter out substandard data, a personnel data quality assessment method named PDQA is proposed. Lastly, we present a model pruning algorithm that significantly reduces the model size while maximizing performance, enabling lightweight deployment. In experiments, we compare the effects of 11 advanced models on completing the knowledge graph of public security personnel information. The results indicate that the RotatE model outperforms other models significantly in knowledge graph completion, with the pruned model size reduced by 70\%, and hits@10 reaching 86.97\%.}</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, Has been accepted by Wireless Network</p></details> |
| **[Block-Diagonal Orthogonal Relation and Matrix Entity for Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05967v1)** | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary aim of Knowledge Graph embeddings (KGE) is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations for predicting missing facts. While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDF-star2Vec: RDF-star Graph Embeddings for Data Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15626v1)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data represent relationships between various entities through the structure of triples (<subject, predicate, object>). Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is crucial in machine learning applications, specifically in node classification and link prediction tasks. KGE remains a vital research topic within the semantic web community. RDF-star introduces the concept of a quoted triple (QT), a specific form of triple employed either as the subject or object within another triple. Moreover, RDF-star permits a QT to act as compositional entities within another QT, thereby enabling the representation of recursive, hyper-relational KGs with nested structures. However, existing KGE models fail to adequately learn the semantics of QTs and entities, primarily because they do not account for RDF-star graphs containing multi-leveled nested QTs and QT-QT relationships. This study introduces RDF-star2Vec, a novel KGE model specifically designed for RDF-star graphs. RDF-star2Vec introduces graph walk techniques that enable probabilistic transitions between a QT and its compositional entities. Feature vectors for QTs, entities, and relations are derived from generated sequences through the structured skip-gram model. Additionally, we provide a dataset and a benchmarking framework for data mining tasks focused on complex RDF-star graphs. Evaluative experiments demonstrated that RDF-star2Vec yielded superior performance compared to recent extensions of RDF2Vec in various tasks including classification, clustering, entity relatedness, and QT similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, and this paper has been accepted by IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Editing Language Model-based Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10405v8)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently decades have witnessed the empirical success of framing Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings via language models. However, language model-based KG embeddings are usually deployed as static artifacts, making them difficult to modify post-deployment without re-training after deployment. To address this issue, we propose a new task of editing language model-based KG embeddings in this paper. This task is designed to facilitate rapid, data-efficient updates to KG embeddings without compromising the performance of other aspects. We build four new datasets: E-FB15k237, A-FB15k237, E-WN18RR, and A-WN18RR, and evaluate several knowledge editing baselines demonstrating the limited ability of previous models to handle the proposed challenging task. We further propose a simple yet strong baseline dubbed KGEditor, which utilizes additional parametric layers of the hypernetwork to edit/add facts. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that KGEditor excels in updating specific facts without impacting the overall performance, even when faced with limited training resources.

However, conventional KGE methods still face challenges when it comes to handling unseen entities or relations during model testing. To address this issue, much effort has been devoted to various fields of KGs. In this paper, we use a set of general terminologies to unify these methods and refer to them collectively as Knowledge Extrapolation. We comprehensively summarize these methods, classified by our proposed taxonomy, and describe their interrelationships. Additionally, we introduce benchmarks and provide comparisons of these methods based on aspects that are not captured by the taxonomy.

Some recent works focus on predicting a vehicle's intention by predicting its trajectory first. This is not enough, as it ignores the context of the scene and the state of the surrounding vehicles (as they might be risky to the target vehicle). Other works assessed the risk made by the surrounding vehicles only by considering their existence around the target vehicle, or by considering the distance and relative velocities between them and the target vehicle as two separate numerical features. In this work, we propose a solution that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to anticipate lane changes based on linguistic contextual information in a way that goes well beyond the capabilities of current perception systems. Our solution takes the Time To Collision (TTC) with surrounding vehicles as input to assess the risk on the target vehicle. Moreover, our KG is trained on the HighD dataset using the TransE model to obtain the Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). Then, we apply Bayesian inference on top of the KG using the embeddings learned during training. Finally, the model can predict lane changes two seconds ahead with 97.95% f1-score, which surpassed the state of the art, and three seconds before changing lanes with 93.60% f1-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sem@$K$: Is my knowledge graph embedding model semantic-aware?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05601v2)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) is a popular approach for predicting links in knowledge graphs (KGs). Traditionally, the performance of KGEMs for link prediction is assessed using rank-based metrics, which evaluate their ability to give high scores to ground-truth entities. However, the literature claims that the KGEM evaluation procedure would benefit from adding supplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our previously introduced metric Sem@K that measures the capability of models to predict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constraints. In particular, we consider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into account to propose different versions of Sem@K. We also perform an extensive study to qualify the abilities of KGEMs as measured by our metric. Our experiments show that Sem@K provides a new perspective on KGEM quality. Its joint analysis with rank-based metrics offers different conclusions on the predictive power of models. Regarding Sem@K, some KGEMs are inherently better than others, but this semantic superiority is not indicative of their performance w.r.t. rank-based metrics. In this work, we generalize conclusions about the relative performance of KGEMs w.r.t. rank-based and semantic-oriented metrics at the level of families of models. The joint analysis of the aforementioned metrics gives more insight into the peculiarities of each model. This work paves the way for a more comprehensive evaluation of KGEM adequacy for specific downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Intervention for Measuring Confidence in Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00041v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying and discovering drug-target interactions(DTIs) are vital steps in drug discovery and development. They play a crucial role in assisting scientists in finding new drugs and accelerating the drug development process. Recently, knowledge graph and knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have made rapid advancements and demonstrated impressive performance in drug discovery. However, such models lack authenticity and accuracy in drug target identification, leading to an increased misjudgment rate and reduced drug development efficiency. To address these issues, we focus on the problem of drug-target interactions, with knowledge mapping as the core technology. Specifically, a causal intervention-based confidence measure is employed to assess the triplet score to improve the accuracy of the drug-target interaction prediction model. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed confidence measurement method based on causal intervention can significantly enhance the accuracy of DTI link prediction, particularly for high-precision models. The predicted results are more valuable in guiding the design and development of subsequent drug development experiments, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Wide to Deep: Dimension Lifting Network for Parameter-efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12816v3)** | 2023-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) that maps entities and relations into vector representations is essential for downstream applications. Conventional KGE methods require high-dimensional representations to learn the complex structure of knowledge graph, but lead to oversized model parameters. Recent advances reduce parameters by low-dimensional entity representations, while developing techniques (e.g., knowledge distillation or reinvented representation forms) to compensate for reduced dimension. However, such operations introduce complicated computations and model designs that may not benefit large knowledge graphs. To seek a simple strategy to improve the parameter efficiency of conventional KGE models, we take inspiration from that deeper neural networks require exponentially fewer parameters to achieve expressiveness comparable to wider networks for compositional structures. We view all entity representations as a single-layer embedding network, and conventional KGE methods that adopt high-dimensional entity representations equal widening the embedding network to gain expressiveness. To achieve parameter efficiency, we instead propose a deeper embedding network for entity representations, i.e., a narrow entity embedding layer plus a multi-layer dimension lifting network (LiftNet). Experiments on three public datasets show that by integrating LiftNet, four conventional KGE methods with 16-dimensional representations achieve comparable link prediction accuracy as original models that adopt 512-dimensional representations, saving 68.4% to 96.9% parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faithful Path Language Modelling for Explainable Recommendation over Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16452v2)** | 2023-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path reasoning methods over knowledge graphs have gained popularity for their potential to improve transparency in recommender systems. However, the resulting models still rely on pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings, fail to fully exploit the interdependence between entities and relations in the KG for recommendation, and may generate inaccurate explanations. In this paper, we introduce PEARLM, a novel approach that efficiently captures user behaviour and product-side knowledge through language modelling. With our approach, knowledge graph embeddings are directly learned from paths over the KG by the language model, which also unifies entities and relations in the same optimisation space. Constraints on the sequence decoding additionally guarantee path faithfulness with respect to the KG. Experiments on two datasets show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Source code and datasets: AVAILABLE AFTER GETTING ACCEPTED.</p></details> |  |

As this representation is obtained from behavioural data, and is not in a form readable by humans, there is a concern that it might incorporate unintended information that could lead to biases. We propose EXTRACT: a suite of Explainable and Transparent methods to ConTrol bias in knowledge graph embeddings, so as to assess and decrease the implicit presence of protected information. Our method uses Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to investigate the presence, extent and origins of information leaks during training, then decomposes embeddings into a sum of their private attributes by solving a linear system. Our experiments, performed on the MovieLens1M dataset, show that a range of personal attributes can be inferred from a user's viewing behaviour and preferences, including gender, age, and occupation. Further experiments, performed on the KG20C citation dataset, show that the information about the conference in which a paper was published can be inferred from the citation network of that article. We propose four transparent methods to maintain the capability of the embedding to make the intended predictions without retaining unwanted information. A trade-off between these two goals is observed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Aequi...</summary><p>Aequitas 2023: Workshop on Fairness and Bias in AI | co-located with ECAI 2023, Krak\'ow, Poland</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedFusionRank, a novel approach to zero-shot medical information retrieval (MIR) that combines the strengths of pre-trained language models and statistical methods while addressing their limitations. The proposed approach leverages a pre-trained BERT-style model to extract compact yet informative keywords. These keywords are then enriched with domain knowledge by linking them to conceptual entities within a medical knowledge graph. Experimental evaluations on medical datasets demonstrate MedFusion Rank's superior performance over existing methods, with promising results with a variety of evaluation metrics. MedFusionRank demonstrates efficacy in retrieving relevant information, even from short or single-term queries.</p></details> |  |

Noun phrases and relational phrases in OKBs often suffer from redundancy and ambiguity, which calls for the investigation on OKB canonicalization. However, in order to meet the requirements of some privacy protection regulations and to ensure the timeliness of the data, the canonicalized OKB often needs to remove some sensitive information or outdated data. The machine unlearning in OKB canonicalization is an excellent solution to the above problem. Current solutions address OKB canonicalization by devising advanced clustering algorithms and using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to further facilitate the canonicalization process. Effective schemes are urgently needed to fully synergise machine unlearning with clustering and KGE learning. To this end, we put forward a multi-task unlearning framework, namely MulCanon, to tackle machine unlearning problem in OKB canonicalization. Specifically, the noise characteristics in the diffusion model are utilized to achieve the effect of machine unlearning for data in OKB. MulCanon unifies the learning objectives of diffusion model, KGE and clustering algorithms, and adopts a two-step multi-task learning paradigm for training. A thorough experimental study on popular OKB canonicalization datasets validates that MulCanon achieves advanced machine unlearning effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14899v1)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the semantics of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction show that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access at https://github.com/dice-group/Universal_Embeddings</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

With data being generated worldwide on a large scale, we see a significant growth in the generation of knowledge graphs. Thing in the future is Orange's take on a knowledge graph in the domain of the Web Of Things (WoT), where the main objective of the platform is to provide a digital representation of the physical world and enable cross-domain applications to be built upon this massive and highly connected graph of things. In this context, as the knowledge graph grows in size, it is prone to have noisy and messy data. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods to learn numerical representations of the graph entities and, subsequently, explore downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and triple classification. We also investigate Graph neural networks (GNN) alongside KGEs and compare their performance on the same downstream tasks. Our evaluation highlights the encouraging performance of both KGE and GNN-based methods on node classification, and the superiority of GNN approaches in the link prediction task. Overall, we show that state-of-the-art approaches are relevant in a WoT context, and this preliminary work provides insights to implement and evaluate them in this context.</p></details> |  |

While existing knowledge graph embedding methods only consider the connections between entities, we propose considering the relationships between triplets. For example, let us consider two triplets $T_1$ and $T_2$ where $T_1$ is (Academy_Awards, Nominates, Avatar) and $T_2$ is (Avatar, Wins, Academy_Awards). Given these two base-level triplets, we see that $T_1$ is a prerequisite for $T_2$. In this paper, we define a higher-level triplet to represent a relationship between triplets, e.g., $\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, $T_2\rangle$ where PrerequisiteFor is a higher-level relation. We define a bi-level knowledge graph that consists of the base-level and the higher-level triplets. We also propose a data augmentation strategy based on the random walks on the bi-level knowledge graph to augment plausible triplets. Our model called BiVE learns embeddings by taking into account the structures of the base-level and the higher-level triplets, with additional consideration of the augmented triplets. We propose two new tasks: triplet prediction and conditional link prediction. Given a triplet $T_1$ and a higher-level relation, the triplet prediction predicts a triplet that is likely to be connected to $T_1$ by the higher-level relation, e.g., $\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, ?$\rangle$. The conditional link prediction predicts a missing entity in a triplet conditioned on another triplet, e.g., $\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, (Avatar, Wins, ?)$\rangle$. Experimental results show that BiVE significantly outperforms all other methods in the two new tasks and the typical base-level link prediction in real-world bi-level knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 15 tables. 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Schema First! Learn Versatile Knowledge Graph Embeddings by Capturing Semantics with MASCHInE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03659v2)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) have gained considerable traction in recent years. These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph entities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning versatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks. However, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their embeddings task-dependent. In parallel, the widespread assumption that KGEMs actually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and relations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been challenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs -- small, modified versions of a KG that leverage RDF/S information. The learnt protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a KG, and can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture semantics. Extensive experiments on various evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the soundness of this approach, which we call Modular and Agnostic SCHema-based Integration of protograph Embeddings (MASCHInE). In particular, MASCHInE helps produce more versatile KGEs that yield substantially better performance for entity clustering and node classification tasks. For link prediction, using MASCHinE substantially increases the number of semantically valid predictions with equivalent rank-based performance.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged so far as a popular form of KR, offering a contextual and human-like representation of knowledge. In international economics, KGs have proven valuable in capturing complex interactions between commodities, companies, and countries. By putting the gravity model, which is a common economic framework, into the process of building KGs, important factors that affect trade relationships can be taken into account, making it possible to predict international trade patterns. This paper proposes an approach that leverages Knowledge Graph embeddings for modeling international trade, focusing on link prediction using embeddings. Thus, valuable insights are offered to policymakers, businesses, and economists, enabling them to anticipate the effects of changes in the international trade system. Moreover, the integration of traditional machine learning methods with KG embeddings, such as decision trees and graph neural networks are also explored. The research findings demonstrate the potential for improving prediction accuracy and provide insights into embedding explainability in knowledge representation. The paper also presents a comprehensive analysis of the influence of embedding methods on other intelligent algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on Journal of King Saud University Computer and Information Sciences</p></details> |

Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL) is widely employed to enhance the distinctiveness of these representations. However, constructing suitable contrastive pairs for CL, especially within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), has been challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel node-based contrastive learning method for knowledge graph embedding, NC-KGE. NC-KGE enhances knowledge extraction in embeddings and speeds up training convergence by constructing appropriate contrastive node pairs on KGs. This scheme can be easily integrated with other knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods. For downstream task such as biochemical relationship prediction, we have incorporated a relation-aware attention mechanism into NC-KGE, focusing on the semantic relationships and node interactions. Extensive experiments show that NC-KGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art models on public datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR.

| **[Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey from the Perspective of Representation Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03536v2)** | 2023-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an increasingly popular technique that aims to represent entities and relations of knowledge graphs into low-dimensional semantic spaces for a wide spectrum of applications such as link prediction, knowledge reasoning and knowledge completion. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) Algebraic perspective, (2) Geometric perspective, and (3) Analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Negative Sampling with Adaptive Denoising Mixup for Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09781v1)** | 2023-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into a low-dimensional and dense vector space via contrasting the positive and negative triples. In the training process of KGEs, negative sampling is essential to find high-quality negative triples since KGs only contain positive triples. Most existing negative sampling methods assume that non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples. However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise. Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also be true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false negative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable denoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by refining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled unlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative triple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself. Secondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to synthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple. Experimental results on the knowledge graph completion task show that the proposed DeMix is superior to other negative sampling techniques, ensuring corresponding KGEs a faster convergence and better link prediction results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISWC 2023</p></details> |
| **[HaSa: Hardness and Structure-Aware Contrastive Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10563v2)** | 2023-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a contrastive learning approach to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) via InfoNCE. For KGE, efficient learning relies on augmenting the training data with negative triples. However, most KGE works overlook the bias from generating the negative triples-false negative triples (factual triples missing from the knowledge graph). We argue that the generation of high-quality (i.e., hard) negative triples might lead to an increase in false negative triples. To mitigate the impact of false negative triples during the generation of hard negative triples, we propose the Hardness and Structure-aware (\textbf{HaSa}) contrastive KGE method, which alleviates the effect of false negative triples while generating the hard negative triples. Experiments show that HaSa improves the performance of InfoNCE-based KGE approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results in several metrics for WN18RR datasets and competitive results for FB15k-237 datasets compared to both classic and pre-trained LM-based KGE methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relation-aware Ensemble Learning for Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08917v1)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and various methods have been proposed to explore semantic patterns in distinctive ways. In this paper, we propose to learn an ensemble by leveraging existing methods in a relation-aware manner. However, exploring these semantics using relation-aware ensemble leads to a much larger search space than general ensemble methods. To address this issue, we propose a divide-search-combine algorithm RelEns-DSC that searches the relation-wise ensemble weights independently. This algorithm has the same computation cost as general ensemble methods but with much better performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in efficiently searching relation-aware ensemble weights and achieving state-of-the-art embedding performance.

| **[Incorporating Domain Knowledge Graph into Multimodal Movie Genre Classification with Self-Supervised Attention and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08032v1)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal movie genre classification has always been regarded as a demanding multi-label classification task due to the diversity of multimodal data such as posters, plot summaries, trailers and metadata. Although existing works have made great progress in modeling and combining each modality, they still face three issues: 1) unutilized group relations in metadata, 2) unreliable attention allocation, and 3) indiscriminative fused features. Given that the knowledge graph has been proven to contain rich information, we present a novel framework that exploits the knowledge graph from various perspectives to address the above problems. As a preparation, the metadata is processed into a domain knowledge graph. A translate model for knowledge graph embedding is adopted to capture the relations between entities. Firstly we retrieve the relevant embedding from the knowledge graph by utilizing group relations in metadata and then integrate it with other modalities. Next, we introduce an Attention Teacher module for reliable attention allocation based on self-supervised learning. It learns the distribution of the knowledge graph and produces rational attention weights. Finally, a Genre-Centroid Anchored Contrastive Learning module is proposed to strengthen the discriminative ability of fused features. The embedding space of anchors is initialized from the genre entities in the knowledge graph. To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a larger and more challenging dataset named MM-IMDb 2.0 compared with the MM-IMDb dataset. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. We will release the code in the near future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2023</p></details> |
| **[Contextualized Structural Self-supervised Learning for Ontology Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03840v1)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontology matching (OM) entails the identification of semantic relationships between concepts within two or more knowledge graphs (KGs) and serves as a critical step in integrating KGs from various sources. Recent advancements in deep OM models have harnessed the power of transformer-based language models and the advantages of knowledge graph embedding. Nevertheless, these OM models still face persistent challenges, such as a lack of reference alignments, runtime latency, and unexplored different graph structures within an end-to-end framework. In this study, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning OM framework with input ontologies, called LaKERMap. This framework capitalizes on the contextual and structural information of concepts by integrating implicit knowledge into transformers. Specifically, we aim to capture multiple structural contexts, encompassing both local and global interactions, by employing distinct training objectives. To assess our methods, we utilize the Bio-ML datasets and tasks. The findings from our innovative approach reveal that LaKERMap surpasses state-of-the-art systems in terms of alignment quality and inference time. Our models and codes are available here: https://github.com/ellenzhuwang/lakermap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong Faithfulness for ELH Ontology Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02198v1)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontology embedding methods are powerful approaches to represent and reason over structured knowledge in various domains. One advantage of ontology embeddings over knowledge graph embeddings is their ability to capture and impose an underlying schema to which the model must conform. Despite advances, most current approaches do not guarantee that the resulting embedding respects the axioms the ontology entails. In this work, we formally prove that normalized ${\cal ELH}$ has the strong faithfulness property on convex geometric models, which means that there is an embedding that precisely captures the original ontology. We present a region-based geometric model for embedding normalized ${\cal ELH}$ ontologies into a continuous vector space. To prove strong faithfulness, our construction takes advantage of the fact that normalized ${\cal ELH}$ has a finite canonical model. We first prove the statement assuming (possibly) non-convex regions, allowing us to keep the required dimensions low. Then, we impose convexity on the regions and show the property still holds. Finally, we consider reasoning tasks on geometric models and analyze the complexity in the class of convex geometric models used for proving strong faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages (including refs.), 5 figures</p></details> |

We present KGEx, a novel post-hoc method that explains individual link predictions by drawing inspiration from surrogate models research. Given a target triple to predict, KGEx trains surrogate KGE models that we use to identify important training triples. To gauge the impact of a training triple, we sample random portions of the target triple neighborhood and we train multiple surrogate KGE models on each of them. To ensure faithfulness, each surrogate is trained by distilling knowledge from the original KGE model. We then assess how well surrogates predict the target triple being explained, the intuition being that those leading to faithful predictions have been trained on impactful neighborhood samples. Under this assumption, we then harvest triples that appear frequently across impactful neighborhoods. We conduct extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, to demonstrate that KGEx is capable of providing explanations faithful to the black-box model.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose a novel recommendation methodology, based on neural embeddings trained on a first-of-a-kind knowledge graph of clinical trials. We addressed several important research questions in this context, including designing a knowledge graph (KG) for clinical trial data, effectiveness of various KG embedding (KGE) methods for it, a novel inductive inference using KGE, and its use in generating recommendations for clinical trial design. We used publicly available data from clinicaltrials.gov for the study. Results show that our recommendations approach achieves relevance scores of 70%-83%, measured as the text similarity to actual clinical trial elements, and the most relevant recommendation can be found near the top of list. Our study also suggests potential improvement in training KGE using node semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (w/o bibliography), 4 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

These mathematically-inspired models are not only highly scalable for inference in large KGs, but also have many explainable advantages in modeling different relation patterns that can be validated through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1) distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend that might help researchers invent novel and more effective models. Next, we delve into CompoundE and CompoundE3D, which draw inspiration from 2D and 3D affine operations, respectively. They encompass a broad spectrum of techniques including distance-based and semantic-based methods. We will also discuss an emerging approach for KG completion which leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) and textual descriptions of entities and relations and offer insights into the integration of KGE embedding methods with PLMs for KG completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-based Subsampling for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09296v1)** | 2023-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subsampling is effective in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) for reducing overfitting caused by the sparsity in Knowledge Graph (KG) datasets. However, current subsampling approaches consider only frequencies of queries that consist of entities and their relations. Thus, the existing subsampling potentially underestimates the appearance probabilities of infrequent queries even if the frequencies of their entities or relations are high. To address this problem, we propose Model-based Subsampling (MBS) and Mixed Subsampling (MIX) to estimate their appearance probabilities through predictions of KGE models. Evaluation results on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 showed that our proposed subsampling methods actually improved the KG completion performances for popular KGE models, RotatE, TransE, HAKE, ComplEx, and DistMult.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AACL 2023; 9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Multi-Lingual Structured Representations of Radiology Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00917v2)** | 2023-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The way we analyse clinical texts has undergone major changes over the last years. The introduction of language models such as BERT led to adaptations for the (bio)medical domain like PubMedBERT and ClinicalBERT. These models rely on large databases of archived medical documents. While performing well in terms of accuracy, both the lack of interpretability and limitations to transfer across languages limit their use in clinical setting. We introduce a novel light-weight graph-based embedding method specifically catering radiology reports. It takes into account the structure and composition of the report, while also connecting medical terms in the report through the multi-lingual SNOMED Clinical Terms knowledge base. The resulting graph embedding uncovers the underlying relationships among clinical terms, achieving a representation that is better understandable for clinicians and clinically more accurate, without reliance on large pre-training datasets. We show the use of this embedding on two tasks namely disease classification of X-ray reports and image classification. For disease classification our model is competitive with its BERT-based counterparts, while being magnitudes smaller in size and training data requirements. For image classification, we show the effectiveness of the graph embedding leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and show how this method is usable across different languages.</p></details> |  |

| **[Extending Transductive Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Inductive Logical Relational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many downstream inference tasks for knowledge graphs, such as relation prediction, have been handled successfully by knowledge graph embedding techniques in the transductive setting. To address the inductive setting wherein new entities are introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time, more recent work opts for models which learn implicit representations of the knowledge graph through a complex function of a network's subgraph structure, often parametrized by graph neural network architectures. These come at the cost of increased parametrization, reduced interpretability and limited generalization to other downstream inference tasks. In this work, we bridge the gap between traditional transductive knowledge graph embedding approaches and more recent inductive relation prediction models by introducing a generalized form of harmonic extension which leverages representations learned through transductive embedding methods to infer representations of new entities introduced at inference time as in the inductive setting. This harmonic extension technique provides the best such approximation, can be implemented via an efficient iterative scheme, and can be employed to answer a family of conjunctive logical queries over the knowledge graph, further expanding the capabilities of transductive embedding methods. In experiments on a number of large-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, we find that this approach for extending the functionality of transductive knowledge graph embedding models to perform knowledge graph completion and answer logical queries in the inductive setting is competitive with--and in some scenarios outperforms--several state-of-the-art models derived explicitly for such inductive tasks.</p></details> |  |

While the majority of approaches concentrate only on relational information, i.e., relations between entities, fewer approaches exist which also take information about literal values (e.g., textual descriptions or numerical information) into account. Those which exist are typically tailored towards a particular modality of literal and a particular embedding method. In this paper, we propose a set of universal preprocessing operators which can be used to transform KGs with literals for numerical, temporal, textual, and image information, so that the transformed KGs can be embedded with any method. The results on the kgbench dataset with three different embedding methods show promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for DL4KG Workshop at ISWC 2023</p></details> |

However, learning representations to capture entities and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile, the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally, we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models.

A Look at Link Prediction, Rule Learning, and Downstream Polypharmacy Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19979v2)** | 2023-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for representing and organising complex biomedical data. Several knowledge graph embedding algorithms have been proposed to learn from and complete knowledge graphs. However, a recent study demonstrates the limited efficacy of these embedding algorithms when applied to biomedical knowledge graphs, raising the question of whether knowledge graph embeddings have limitations in biomedical settings. This study aims to apply state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models in the context of a recent biomedical knowledge graph, BioKG, and evaluate their performance and potential downstream uses. We achieve a three-fold improvement in terms of performance based on the HITS@10 score over previous work on the same biomedical knowledge graph. Additionally, we provide interpretable predictions through a rule-based method. We demonstrate that knowledge graph embedding models are applicable in practice by evaluating the best-performing model on four tasks that represent real-life polypharmacy situations. Results suggest that knowledge learnt from large biomedical knowledge graphs can be transferred to such downstream use cases.

Knowledge bases such as WikiData provide large-scale, high-quality representations of inferential semantics and world knowledge. We show that large language models learn to organize concepts in ways that are strikingly similar to how concepts are organized in such knowledge bases. Knowledge bases model collective, institutional knowledge, and large language models seem to induce such knowledge from raw text. We show that bigger and better models exhibit more human-like concept organization, across four families of language models and three knowledge graph embeddings.</p></details> |  |

GLUE tasks measure the reliability scores using inter annotator metrics i.e. Cohens Kappa. However, the reliability aspect of LMs has often been overlooked. To counter this problem, we explore a knowledge-guided LM ensembling approach that leverages reinforcement learning to integrate knowledge from ConceptNet and Wikipedia as knowledge graph embeddings. This approach mimics human annotators resorting to external knowledge to compensate for information deficits in the datasets. Across nine GLUE datasets, our research shows that ensembling strengthens reliability and accuracy scores, outperforming state of the art.</p></details> | Accepted at CIKM'23 |

A key task in the literature is predicting missing links between entities. However, Knowledge Graphs are not just sets of links but also have semantics underlying their structure. Semantics is crucial in several downstream tasks, such as query answering or reasoning. We introduce the subgraph inference task, where a model has to generate likely and semantically valid subgraphs. We propose IntelliGraphs, a set of five new Knowledge Graph datasets. The IntelliGraphs datasets contain subgraphs with semantics expressed in logical rules for evaluating subgraph inference. We also present the dataset generator that produced the synthetic datasets. We designed four novel baseline models, which include three models based on traditional KGEs. We evaluate their expressiveness and show that these models cannot capture the semantics. We believe this benchmark will encourage the development of machine learning models that emphasize semantic understanding.</p></details> |  |

One essential part of library migration is to find an analogical API that could provide the same functionality as current ones. However, given the large number of libraries/APIs, manually finding an analogical API could be very time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers have developed multiple automated analogical API recommendation techniques. Documentation-based methods have particularly attracted significant interest. Despite their potential, these methods have limitations, such as a lack of comprehensive semantic understanding in documentation and scalability challenges. In this work, we propose KGE4AR, a novel documentation-based approach that leverages knowledge graph (KG) embedding to recommend analogical APIs during library migration. Specifically, KGE4AR proposes a novel unified API KG to comprehensively and structurally represent three types of knowledge in documentation, which can better capture the high-level semantics. Moreover, KGE4AR then proposes to embed the unified API KG into vectors, enabling more effective and scalable similarity calculation. We build KGE4AR' s unified API KG for 35,773 Java libraries and assess it in two API recommendation scenarios: with and without target libraries. Our results show that KGE4AR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art documentation-based techniques in both evaluation scenarios in terms of all metrics (e.g., 47.1%-143.0% and 11.7%-80.6% MRR improvements in each scenario). Additionally, we explore KGE4AR' s scalability, confirming its effective scaling with the growing number of libraries.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2023 |

While existing hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding methods assume that the entities are discrete objects, some information should be represented using numeric values, e.g., (J.R.R., was born in, 1892). Also, a triplet (J.R.R., educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a qualifier such as (start time, 1911). In this paper, we propose a unified framework named HyNT that learns representations of a hyper-relational knowledge graph containing numeric literals in either triplets or qualifiers. We define a context transformer and a prediction transformer to learn the representations based not only on the correlations between a triplet and its qualifiers but also on the numeric information. By learning compact representations of triplets and qualifiers and feeding them into the transformers, we reduce the computation cost of using transformers. Using HyNT, we can predict missing numeric values in addition to missing entities or relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph. Experimental results show that HyNT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables. 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2023)</p></details> |

While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Development of a Knowledge Graph Embeddings Model for Pain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08904v1)** | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pain is a complex concept that can interconnect with other concepts such as a disorder that might cause pain, a medication that might relieve pain, and so on. To fully understand the context of pain experienced by either an individual or across a population, we may need to examine all concepts related to pain and the relationships between them. This is especially useful when modeling pain that has been recorded in electronic health records. Knowledge graphs represent concepts and their relations by an interlinked network, enabling semantic and context-based reasoning in a computationally tractable form. These graphs can, however, be too large for efficient computation. Knowledge graph embeddings help to resolve this by representing the graphs in a low-dimensional vector space. These embeddings can then be used in various downstream tasks such as classification and link prediction. The various relations associated with pain which are required to construct such a knowledge graph can be obtained from external medical knowledge bases such as SNOMED CT, a hierarchical systematic nomenclature of medical terms. A knowledge graph built in this way could be further enriched with real-world examples of pain and its relations extracted from electronic health records. This paper describes the construction of such knowledge graph embedding models of pain concepts, extracted from the unstructured text of mental health electronic health records, combined with external knowledge created from relations described in SNOMED CT, and their evaluation on a subject-object link prediction task. The performance of the models was compared with other baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AMIA 2023, New Orleans</p></details> |

For each of the two modalities dedicated approaches for graph embedding and language models learn patterns that allow for predicting novel structural knowledge. Few approaches have integrated learning and inference with both modalities and these existing ones could only partially exploit the interaction of structural and textual knowledge. In our approach, we build on existing strong representations of single modalities and we use hypercomplex algebra to represent both, (i), single-modality embedding as well as, (ii), the interaction between different modalities and their complementary means of knowledge representation. More specifically, we suggest Dihedron and Quaternion representations of 4D hypercomplex numbers to integrate four modalities namely structural knowledge graph embedding, word-level representations (e.g.\ Word2vec, Fasttext), sentence-level representations (Sentence transformer), and document-level representations (sentence transformer, Doc2vec). Our unified vector representation scores the plausibility of labelled edges via Hamilton and Dihedron products, thus modeling pairwise interactions between different modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation on standard benchmark datasets shows the superiority of our two new models using abundant textual information besides sparse structural knowledge to enhance performance in link prediction tasks.</p></details> | ISWC2023 version |
| **[A Comprehensive Study on Knowledge Graph Embedding over Relational Patterns Based on Rule Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07889v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has proven to be an effective approach to solving the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task. Relational patterns which refer to relations with specific semantics exhibiting graph patterns are an important factor in the performance of KGE models. Though KGE models' capabilities are analyzed over different relational patterns in theory and a rough connection between better relational patterns modeling and better performance of KGC has been built, a comprehensive quantitative analysis on KGE models over relational patterns remains absent so it is uncertain how the theoretical support of KGE to a relational pattern contributes to the performance of triples associated to such a relational pattern. To address this challenge, we evaluate the performance of 7 KGE models over 4 common relational patterns on 2 benchmarks, then conduct an analysis in theory, entity frequency, and part-to-whole three aspects and get some counterintuitive conclusions. Finally, we introduce a training-free method Score-based Patterns Adaptation (SPA) to enhance KGE models' performance over various relational patterns. This approach is simple yet effective and can be applied to KGE models without additional training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method generally enhances performance over specific relational patterns.

| **[RECipe: Does a Multi-Modal Recipe Knowledge Graph Fit a Multi-Purpose Recommendation System?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04579v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, recommendation systems (RSs) have used machine learning (ML) solutions to recommend items, e.g., movies, books, and restaurants, to clients of a business or an online platform. Recipe recommendation, however, has not yet received much attention compared to those applications. We introduce RECipe as a multi-purpose recipe recommendation framework with a multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) backbone. The motivation behind RECipe is to go beyond (deep) neural collaborative filtering (NCF) by recommending recipes to users when they query in natural language or by providing an image. RECipe consists of 3 subsystems: (1) behavior-based recommender, (2) review-based recommender, and (3) image-based recommender. Each subsystem relies on the embedding representations of entities and relations in the graph. We first obtain (pre-trained) embedding representations of textual entities, such as reviews or ingredients, from a fine-tuned model of Microsoft's MPNet. We initialize the weights of the entities with these embeddings to train our knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model. For the visual component, i.e., recipe images, we develop a KGE-Guided variational autoencoder (KG-VAE) to learn the distribution of images and their latent representations. Once KGE and KG-VAE models are fully trained, we use them as a multi-purpose recommendation framework. For benchmarking, we created two knowledge graphs (KGs) from public datasets on Kaggle for recipe recommendation. Our experiments show that the KGE models have comparable performance to the neural solutions. We also present pre-trained NLP embeddings to address important applications such as zero-shot inference for new users (or the cold start problem) and conditional recommendation with respect to recipe categories. We eventually demonstrate the application of RECipe in a multi-purpose recommendation setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The vast majority of these relations are defined as positive statements, but the importance of negative statements is increasingly recognized, especially under an Open World Assumption. Explicitly considering negative statements has been shown to improve performance on tasks such as entity summarization and question answering or domain-specific tasks such as protein function prediction. However, no attention has been given to the exploration of negative statements by knowledge graph embedding approaches despite the potential of negative statements to produce more accurate representations of entities in a knowledge graph. We propose a novel approach, TrueWalks, to incorporate negative statements into the knowledge graph representation learning process. In particular, we present a novel walk-generation method that is able to not only differentiate between positive and negative statements but also take into account the semantic implications of negation in ontology-rich knowledge graphs. This is of particular importance for applications in the biomedical domain, where the inadequacy of embedding approaches regarding negative statements at the ontology level has been identified as a crucial limitation. We evaluate TrueWalks in ontology-rich biomedical knowledge graphs in two different predictive tasks based on KG embeddings: protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction. We conduct an extensive analysis over established benchmarks and demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings on all tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

However, they usually cannot avoid rule grounding, and injecting a diverse set of rules has still not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we propose InjEx, a mechanism to inject multiple types of rules through simple constraints, which capture definite Horn rules. To start, we theoretically prove that InjEx can inject such rules. Next, to demonstrate that InjEx infuses interpretable prior knowledge into the embedding space, we evaluate InjEx on both the knowledge graph completion (KGC) and few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) settings. Our experimental results reveal that InjEx outperforms both baseline KGC models as well as specialized few-shot models while maintaining its scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Literal-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding for Welding Quality Monitoring: A Bosch Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01105v1)** | 2023-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there has been a series of studies in knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which attempts to learn the embeddings of the entities and relations as numerical vectors and mathematical mappings via machine learning (ML). However, there has been limited research that applies KGE for industrial problems in manufacturing. This paper investigates whether and to what extent KGE can be used for an important problem: quality monitoring for welding in manufacturing industry, which is an impactful process accounting for production of millions of cars annually. The work is in line with Bosch research of data-driven solutions that intends to replace the traditional way of destroying cars, which is extremely costly and produces waste. The paper tackles two very challenging questions simultaneously: how large the welding spot diameter is; and to which car body the welded spot belongs to. The problem setting is difficult for traditional ML because there exist a high number of car bodies that should be assigned as class labels. We formulate the problem as link prediction, and experimented popular KGE methods on real industry data, with consideration of literals. Our results reveal both limitations and promising aspects of adapted KGE methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ISWC2023 In-Use track</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose kNN-KGE, a new knowledge graph embedding approach with pre-trained language models, by linearly interpolating its entity distribution with k-nearest neighbors. We compute the nearest neighbors based on the distance in the entity embedding space from the knowledge store. Our approach can allow rare or emerging entities to be memorized explicitly rather than implicitly in model parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can improve inductive and transductive link prediction results and yield better performance for low-resource settings with only a few triples, which might be easier to reason via explicit memory.

| **[CausE: Towards Causal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11610v2)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) focuses on representing the entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into the continuous vector spaces, which can be employed to predict the missing triples to achieve knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, KGE models often only briefly learn structural correlations of triple data and embeddings would be misled by the trivial patterns and noisy links in real-world KGs. To address this issue, we build the new paradigm of KGE in the context of causality and embedding disentanglement. We further propose a Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding (CausE) framework. CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CausE could outperform the baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art KGC performance. We release our code in https://github.com/zjukg/CausE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CCKS 2023 as a research paper</p></details> |
| **[Fast Knowledge Graph Completion using Graphics Processing Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12059v1)** | 2023-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs can be used in many areas related to data semantics such as question-answering systems, knowledge based systems. However, the currently constructed knowledge graphs need to be complemented for better knowledge in terms of relations. It is called knowledge graph completion. To add new relations to the existing knowledge graph by using knowledge graph embedding models, we have to evaluate $N\times N \times R$ vector operations, where $N$ is the number of entities and $R$ is the number of relation types. It is very costly. In this paper, we provide an efficient knowledge graph completion framework on GPUs to get new relations using knowledge graph embedding vectors. In the proposed framework, we first define "transformable to a metric space" and then provide a method to transform the knowledge graph completion problem into the similarity join problem for a model which is "transformable to a metric space". After that, to efficiently process the similarity join problem, we derive formulas using the properties of a metric space. Based on the formulas, we develop a fast knowledge graph completion algorithm. Finally, we experimentally show that our framework can efficiently process the knowledge graph completion problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmark datasets for biomedical knowledge graphs with negative statements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11719v1)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent facts about real-world entities. Most of these facts are defined as positive statements. The negative statements are scarce but highly relevant under the open-world assumption. Furthermore, they have been demonstrated to improve the performance of several applications, namely in the biomedical domain. However, no benchmark dataset supports the evaluation of the methods that consider these negative statements. We present a collection of datasets for three relation prediction tasks - protein-protein interaction prediction, gene-disease association prediction and disease prediction - that aim at circumventing the difficulties in building benchmarks for knowledge graphs with negative statements. These datasets include data from two successful biomedical ontologies, Gene Ontology and Human Phenotype Ontology, enriched with negative statements. We also generate knowledge graph embeddings for each dataset with two popular path-based methods and evaluate the performance in each task. The results show that the negative statements can improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Personalized Recommender System Based-on Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10680v1)** | 2023-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs have proven to be effective for modeling entities and their relationships through the use of ontologies. The recent emergence in interest for using knowledge graphs as a form of information modeling has led to their increased adoption in recommender systems. By incorporating users and items into the knowledge graph, these systems can better capture the implicit connections between them and provide more accurate recommendations. In this paper, we investigate and propose the construction of a personalized recommender system via knowledge graphs embedding applied to the vehicle purchase/sale domain. The results of our experimentation demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in providing relevant recommendations that are consistent with individual users.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulE: Neural-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Rule Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14905v2)** | 2023-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning is an important problem for knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel and principled framework called \textbf{RulE} (stands for {Rul}e {E}mbedding) to effectively leverage logical rules to enhance KG reasoning. Unlike knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods, RulE learns rule embeddings from existing triplets and first-order {rules} by jointly representing \textbf{entities}, \textbf{relations} and \textbf{logical rules} in a unified embedding space. Based on the learned rule embeddings, a confidence score can be calculated for each rule, reflecting its consistency with the observed triplets. This allows us to perform logical rule inference in a soft way, thus alleviating the brittleness of logic. On the other hand, RulE injects prior logical rule information into the embedding space, enriching and regularizing the entity/relation embeddings. This makes KGE alone perform better too. RulE is conceptually simple and empirically effective. We conduct extensive experiments to verify each component of RulE. Results on multiple benchmarks reveal that our model outperforms the majority of existing embedding-based and rule-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Heterogeneous Graph Learning with Weighted Mixed-Curvature Product Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04514v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph representation learning, it is important that the complex geometric structure of the input graph, e.g. hidden relations among nodes, is well captured in embedding space. However, standard Euclidean embedding spaces have a limited capacity in representing graphs of varying structures. A promising candidate for the faithful embedding of data with varying structure is product manifolds of component spaces of different geometries (spherical, hyperbolic, or euclidean). In this paper, we take a closer look at the structure of product manifold embedding spaces and argue that each component space in a product contributes differently to expressing structures in the input graph, hence should be weighted accordingly. This is different from previous works which consider the roles of different components equally. We then propose WEIGHTED-PM, a data-driven method for learning embedding of heterogeneous graphs in weighted product manifolds. Our method utilizes the topological information of the input graph to automatically determine the weight of each component in product spaces. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate that WEIGHTED-PM is capable of learning better graph representations with lower geometric distortion from input data, and performs better on multiple downstream tasks, such as word similarity learning, top-$k$ recommendation, and knowledge graph embedding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept2Box: Joint Geometric Embeddings for Learning Two-View Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01933v1)** | 2023-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been extensively studied to embed large-scale relational data for many real-world applications. Existing methods have long ignored the fact many KGs contain two fundamentally different views: high-level ontology-view concepts and fine-grained instance-view entities. They usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings, which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity. Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly. Experiments on both the public DBpedia KG and a newly-created industrial KG showed the effectiveness of Concept2Box.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Representations for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12687v1)** | 2023-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent real-world entities and their relations in a semantically-rich structure supported by ontologies. Exploring this data with machine learning methods often relies on knowledge graph embeddings, which produce latent representations of entities that preserve structural and local graph neighbourhood properties, but sacrifice explainability. However, in tasks such as link or relation prediction, understanding which specific features better explain a relation is crucial to support complex or critical applications. We propose SEEK, a novel approach for explainable representations to support relation prediction in knowledge graphs. It is based on identifying relevant shared semantic aspects (i.e., subgraphs) between entities and learning representations for each subgraph, producing a multi-faceted and explainable representation. We evaluate SEEK on two real-world highly complex relation prediction tasks: protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction. Our extensive analysis using established benchmarks demonstrates that SEEK achieves significantly better performance than standard learning representation methods while identifying both sufficient and necessary explanations based on shared semantic aspects.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Contextual Dictionary Lookup for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07719v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to solve the incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) by predicting missing links from known triples, numbers of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been proposed to perform KGC by learning embeddings. Nevertheless, most existing embedding models map each relation into a unique vector, overlooking the specific fine-grained semantics of them under different entities. Additionally, the few available fine-grained semantic models rely on clustering algorithms, resulting in limited performance and applicability due to the cumbersome two-stage training process. In this paper, we present a novel method utilizing contextual dictionary lookup, enabling conventional embedding models to learn fine-grained semantics of relations in an end-to-end manner. More specifically, we represent each relation using a dictionary that contains multiple latent semantics. The composition of a given entity and the dictionary's central semantics serves as the context for generating a lookup, thus determining the fine-grained semantics of the relation adaptively. The proposed loss function optimizes both the central and fine-grained semantics simultaneously to ensure their semantic consistency. Besides, we introduce two metrics to assess the validity and accuracy of the dictionary lookup operation. We extend several KGE models with the method, resulting in substantial performance improvements on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning Based on Relation-Symmetrical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10738v4)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims at learning powerful representations to benefit various artificial intelligence applications. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has been widely leveraged in graph learning as an effective mechanism to enhance the discriminative capacity of the learned representations. However, the complex structures of KG make it hard to construct appropriate contrastive pairs. Only a few attempts have integrated contrastive learning strategies with KGE. But, most of them rely on language models ( e.g., Bert) for contrastive pair construction instead of fully mining information underlying the graph structure, hindering expressive ability. Surprisingly, we find that the entities within a relational symmetrical structure are usually similar and correlated. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph contrastive learning framework based on relation-symmetrical structure, KGE-SymCL, which mines symmetrical structure information in KGs to enhance the discriminative ability of KGE models. Concretely, a plug-and-play approach is proposed by taking entities in the relation-symmetrical positions as positive pairs. Besides, a self-supervised alignment loss is designed to pull together positive pairs. Experimental results on link prediction and entity classification datasets demonstrate that our KGE-SymCL can be easily adopted to various KGE models for performance improvements. Moreover, extensive experiments show that our model could outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE for publication.

Recently, embedding methods have been used for entity alignment tasks, that learn a vector-space representation of entities which preserves their similarity in the original KGs. A wide variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods have been proposed that exploit both factual (attribute based) and structural information (relation based) of entities in the KGs. Still, a quantitative assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in real-world KGs according to different performance metrics and KG characteristics is missing from the literature. In this work, we conduct the first meta-level analysis of popular embedding methods for entity alignment, based on a statistically sound methodology. Our analysis reveals statistically significant correlations of different embedding methods with various meta-features extracted by KGs and rank them in a statistically significant way according to their effectiveness across all real-world KGs of our testbed. Finally, we study interesting trade-offs in terms of methods' effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

Several methods have surfaced as of late, exhibiting notable performance in addressing the task; however, most of these approaches rely on vast amounts of data from large-scale knowledge graphs or language models pretrained on voluminous corpora. In this paper, we hone in on the effective utilization of solely the knowledge supplied by a corpus to create a high-performing model. Our objective is to showcase that by leveraging the hierarchical structure and relational distribution of entities within a corpus without introducing external knowledge, a relation extraction model can achieve significantly enhanced performance. We therefore proposed a relation extraction approach based on the incorporation of pretrained knowledge graph embeddings at the corpus scale into the sentence-level contextual representation. We conducted a series of experiments which revealed promising and very interesting results for our proposed approach.The obtained results demonstrated an outperformance of our method compared to context-based relation extraction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figures, The 17th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition</p></details> |

Entity alignment (EA) is a critical step in this process. Despite recent considerable research progress in embedding-based EA, how it works remains to be explored. In this paper, we provide a similarity flooding perspective to explain existing translation-based and aggregation-based EA models. We prove that the embedding learning process of these models actually seeks a fixpoint of pairwise similarities between entities. We also provide experimental evidence to support our theoretical analysis. We propose two simple but effective methods inspired by the fixpoint computation in similarity flooding, and demonstrate their effectiveness on benchmark datasets. Our work bridges the gap between recent embedding-based models and the conventional similarity flooding algorithm. It would improve our understanding of and increase our faith in embedding-based EA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Embedding with Electronic Health Records Data via Latent Graphical Block Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19997v1)** | 2023-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR), large scale EHRs have become another rich data source for translational clinical research. Despite its potential, deriving generalizable knowledge from EHR data remains challenging. First, EHR data are generated as part of clinical care with data elements too detailed and fragmented for research. Despite recent progress in mapping EHR data to common ontology with hierarchical structures, much development is still needed to enable automatic grouping of local EHR codes to meaningful clinical concepts at a large scale. Second, the total number of unique EHR features is large, imposing methodological challenges to derive reproducible knowledge graph, especially when interest lies in conditional dependency structure. Third, the detailed EHR data on a very large patient cohort imposes additional computational challenge to deriving a knowledge network. To overcome these challenges, we propose to infer the conditional dependency structure among EHR features via a latent graphical block model (LGBM). The LGBM has a two layer structure with the first providing semantic embedding vector (SEV) representation for the EHR features and the second overlaying a graphical block model on the latent SEVs. The block structures on the graphical model also allows us to cluster synonymous features in EHR. We propose to learn the LGBM efficiently, in both statistical and computational sense, based on the empirical point mutual information matrix. We establish the statistical rates of the proposed estimators and show the perfect recovery of the block structure. Numerical results from simulation studies and real EHR data analyses suggest that the proposed LGBM estimator performs well in finite sample.</p></details> |  |

Our work expands on KGT5, a recent LP model that exploits textual features of the KG, has small model size, and is scalable. To reach good predictive performance, however, KGT5 relies on an ensemble with a knowledge graph embedding model, which itself is excessively large and costly to use. In this short paper, we show empirically that adding contextual information - i.e., information about the direct neighborhood of the query entity - alleviates the need for a separate KGE model to obtain good performance. The resulting KGT5-context model is simple, reduces model size significantly, and obtains state-of-the-art performance in our experimental study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, lots of these methods neglect the importance of the information of relations and combine it with the information of entities inefficiently, leading to low expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a general knowledge graph encoder incorporating tensor decomposition in the aggregation function of Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN). In our model, neighbor entities are transformed using projection matrices of a low-rank tensor which are defined by relation types to benefit from multi-task learning and produce expressive relation-aware representations. Besides, we propose a low-rank estimation of the core tensor using CP decomposition to compress and regularize our model. We use a training method inspired by contrastive learning, which relieves the training limitation of the 1-N method on huge graphs. We achieve favorably competitive results on FB15k-237 and WN18RR with embeddings in comparably lower dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |

Summarization models have been used for this task to generate clinical notes as summaries of doctor-patient conversations (Krishna et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2022). However, assessing which model would best serve clinicians in their daily practice is still a challenging task due to the large set of possible correct summaries, and the potential limitations of automatic evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study evaluation methods and metrics for the automatic generation of clinical notes from medical conversations. In particular, we propose new task-specific metrics and we compare them to SOTA evaluation metrics in text summarization and generation, including: (i) knowledge-graph embedding-based metrics, (ii) customized model-based metrics, (iii) domain-adapted/fine-tuned metrics, and (iv) ensemble metrics. To study the correlation between the automatic metrics and manual judgments, we evaluate automatic notes/summaries by comparing the system and reference facts and computing the factual correctness, and the hallucination and omission rates for critical medical facts. This study relied on seven datasets manually annotated by domain experts. Our experiments show that automatic evaluation metrics can have substantially different behaviors on different types of clinical notes datasets. However, the results highlight one stable subset of metrics as the most correlated with human judgments with a relevant aggregation of different evaluation criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings 2023</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the lack of a large-scale, comprehensive, and easy-to-use resource capturing the myriad relationships between publications, their authors, and venues presents a barrier to applications for gaining a deeper understanding of science. In this paper, we present PubGraph, a new resource for studying scientific progress that takes the form of a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) with more than 385M entities, 13B main edges, and 1.5B qualifier edges. PubGraph is comprehensive and unifies data from various sources, including Wikidata, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, using the Wikidata ontology. Beyond the metadata available from these sources, PubGraph includes outputs from auxiliary community detection algorithms and large language models. To further support studies on reasoning over scientific networks, we create several large-scale benchmarks extracted from PubGraph for the core task of knowledge graph completion (KGC). These benchmarks present many challenges for knowledge graph embedding models, including an adversarial community-based KGC evaluation setting, zero-shot inductive learning, and large-scale learning. All of the aforementioned resources are accessible at https://pubgraph.isi.edu/ and released under the CC-BY-SA license.

With larger parameter spaces, HGNNs may require more training data, which is often scarce in real-world applications due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to train a GNN collaboratively without sharing their local data. However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. FedHGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

In this paper, we present extensions to Saga our platform for continuous construction and serving of knowledge at scale. In particular, we describe a pipeline for training knowledge graph embeddings that powers key capabilities such as fact ranking, fact verification, a related entities service, and support for entity linking. We then describe how our platform, including graph embeddings, can be leveraged to create a Semantic Annotation service that links unstructured Web documents to entities in our KG. Semantic annotation of the Web effectively expands our knowledge graph with edges to open-domain Web content which can be used in various search and ranking problems. Finally, we leverage annotated Web documents to drive Open-domain Knowledge Extraction. This targeted extraction framework identifies important coverage issues in the KG, then finds relevant data sources for target entities on the Web and extracts missing information to enrich the KG. Finally, we describe adaptations to our knowledge platform needed to construct and serve private personal knowledge on-device. This includes private incremental KG construction, cross-device knowledge sync, and global knowledge enrichment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in SIGMOD 2023</p></details> |

| **[Analyzing Knowledge Graph Embedding Methods from a Multi-Embedding Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11406v4)** | 2023-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph is a popular format for representing knowledge, with many applications to semantic search engines, question-answering systems, and recommender systems. Real-world knowledge graphs are usually incomplete, so knowledge graph embedding methods, such as Canonical decomposition/Parallel factorization (CP), DistMult, and ComplEx, have been proposed to address this issue. These methods represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space and predict the links between them. The embedding vectors themselves contain rich semantic information and can be used in other applications such as data analysis. However, mechanisms in these models and the embedding vectors themselves vary greatly, making it difficult to understand and compare them. Given this lack of understanding, we risk using them ineffectively or incorrectly, particularly for complicated models, such as CP, with two role-based embedding vectors, or the state-of-the-art ComplEx model, with complex-valued embedding vectors. In this paper, we propose a multi-embedding interaction mechanism as a new approach to uniting and generalizing these models. We derive them theoretically via this mechanism and provide empirical analyses and comparisons between them. We also propose a new multi-embedding model based on quaternion algebra and show that it achieves promising results using popular benchmarks.

However, existing NS methods are unsuitable when multi-modal information is considered in KGE models. They are also inefficient due to their complex design. In this paper, we propose Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS) for multi-modal knowledge graph embedding (MMKGE) to address the mentioned problems. MANS could align structural and visual embeddings for entities in KGs and learn meaningful embeddings to perform better in multi-modal KGE while keeping lightweight and efficient. Empirical results on two benchmarks demonstrate that MANS outperforms existing NS methods. Meanwhile, we make further explorations about MANS to confirm its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN2023.

| **[Quantifying and Defending against Privacy Threats on Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02932v1)** | 2023-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a fundamental technique that extracts expressive representation from knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate diverse downstream tasks. The emerging federated KGE (FKGE) collaboratively trains from distributed KGs held among clients while avoiding exchanging clients' sensitive raw KGs, which can still suffer from privacy threats as evidenced in other federated model trainings (e.g., neural networks). However, quantifying and defending against such privacy threats remain unexplored for FKGE which possesses unique properties not shared by previously studied models. In this paper, we conduct the first holistic study of the privacy threat on FKGE from both attack and defense perspectives. For the attack, we quantify the privacy threat by proposing three new inference attacks, which reveal substantial privacy risk by successfully inferring the existence of the KG triple from victim clients. For the defense, we propose DP-Flames, a novel differentially private FKGE with private selection, which offers a better privacy-utility tradeoff by exploiting the entity-binding sparse gradient property of FKGE and comes with a tight privacy accountant by incorporating the state-of-the-art private selection technique. We further propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation policy to dynamically adjust defense magnitude across the training procedure. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed defense can successfully mitigate the privacy threat by effectively reducing the success rate of inference attacks from $83.1\%$ to $59.4\%$ on average with only a modest utility decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the ACM Web Conference (WWW 2023)</p></details> |

Most of the existing video understanding works only focus on the information that appeared within the video content, including the video frames, audio and text. However, introducing common sense knowledge from the external Knowledge Graph (KG) dataset is essential for video understanding when referring to the content which is less relevant to the video. Owing to the lack of video knowledge graph dataset, the work which integrates video understanding and KG is rare. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous dataset that contains the multi-modal video entity and fruitful common sense relations. This dataset also provides multiple novel video inference tasks like the Video-Relation-Tag (VRT) and Video-Relation-Video (VRV) tasks. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end model that jointly optimizes the video understanding objective with knowledge graph embedding, which can not only better inject factual knowledge into video understanding but also generate effective multi-modal entity embedding for KG. Comprehensive experiments indicate that combining video understanding embedding with factual knowledge benefits the content-based video retrieval performance. Moreover, it also helps the model generate better knowledge graph embedding which outperforms traditional KGE-based methods on VRT and VRV tasks with at least 42.36% and 17.73% improvement in HITS@10.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Embedding with 3D Compound Geometric Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00378v1)** | 2023-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cascade of 2D geometric transformations were exploited to model relations between entities in a knowledge graph (KG), leading to an effective KG embedding (KGE) model, CompoundE. Furthermore, the rotation in the 3D space was proposed as a new KGE model, Rotate3D, by leveraging its non-commutative property. Inspired by CompoundE and Rotate3D, we leverage 3D compound geometric transformations, including translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, and shear and propose a family of KGE models, named CompoundE3D, in this work. CompoundE3D allows multiple design variants to match rich underlying characteristics of a KG. Since each variant has its own advantages on a subset of relations, an ensemble of multiple variants can yield superior performance. The effectiveness and flexibility of CompoundE3D are experimentally verified on four popular link prediction datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DHGE: Dual-View Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction and Entity Typing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08562v4)** | 2023-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of representation learning on knowledge graphs (KGs), a hyper-relational fact consists of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value descriptions, which is considered more comprehensive and specific than a triple-based fact. However, currently available hyper-relational KG embedding methods in a single view are limited in application because they weaken the hierarchical structure that represents the affiliation between entities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-view hyper-relational KG structure (DH-KG) that contains a hyper-relational instance view for entities and a hyper-relational ontology view for concepts that are abstracted hierarchically from the entities. This paper defines link prediction and entity typing tasks on DH-KG for the first time and constructs two DH-KG datasets, JW44K-6K, extracted from Wikidata, and HTDM based on medical data. Furthermore, we propose DHGE, a DH-KG embedding model based on GRAN encoders, HGNNs, and joint learning. DHGE outperforms baseline models on DH-KG, according to experimental results. Finally, we provide an example of how this technology can be used to treat hypertension. Our model and new datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |
| **[Joint embedding in Hierarchical distance and semantic representation learning for link prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15655v1)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The link prediction task aims to predict missing entities or relations in the knowledge graph and is essential for the downstream application. Existing well-known models deal with this task by mainly focusing on representing knowledge graph triplets in the distance space or semantic space. However, they can not fully capture the information of head and tail entities, nor even make good use of hierarchical level information. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model for the link prediction task, namely, HIE, which models each triplet (\textit{h}, \textit{r}, \textit{t}) into distance measurement space and semantic measurement space, simultaneously. Moreover, HIE is introduced into hierarchical-aware space to leverage rich hierarchical information of entities and relations for better representation learning. Specifically, we apply distance transformation operation on the head entity in distance space to obtain the tail entity instead of translation-based or rotation-based approaches. Experimental results of HIE on four real-world datasets show that HIE outperforms several existing state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding methods on the link prediction task and deals with complex relations accurately.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Big Data research one year ago</p></details> |

| **[Graph Neural Aggregation-diffusion with Metastability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20221v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous graph neural models based on differential equations have expanded the architecture of graph neural networks (GNNs). Due to the connection between graph diffusion and message passing, diffusion-based models have been widely studied. However, diffusion naturally drives the system towards an equilibrium state, leading to issues like over-smoothing. To this end, we propose GRADE inspired by graph aggregation-diffusion equations, which includes the delicate balance between nonlinear diffusion and aggregation induced by interaction potentials. The node representations obtained through aggregation-diffusion equations exhibit metastability, indicating that features can aggregate into multiple clusters. In addition, the dynamics within these clusters can persist for long time periods, offering the potential to alleviate over-smoothing effects. This nonlinear diffusion in our model generalizes existing diffusion-based models and establishes a connection with classical GNNs. We prove that GRADE achieves competitive performance across various benchmarks and alleviates the over-smoothing issue in GNNs evidenced by the enhanced Dirichlet energy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

We use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained with a surrogate loss function to generate an embedding for each node. We use these embeddings to construct a heat map that indicates the likelihood of each edge being part of the optimal route. We then apply local search to generate our final predictions. Our investigation explores how different training instance sizes, embedding dimensions, and distributions influence the outcomes of Unsupervised Learning methods. Our results show that training with larger instance sizes and increasing embedding dimensions can build a more effective representation, enhancing the model's ability to solve TSP. Furthermore, in evaluating generalization across different distributions, we first determine the hardness of various distributions and explore how different hardnesses affect the final results. Our findings suggest that models trained on harder instances exhibit better generalization capabilities, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate training instances in solving TSP using Unsupervised Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11624v3)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences. Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interaction relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant shortcomings: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations in the behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interaction relations, and includes a relation chain representation learning and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our \model surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06\% and 12.15\% on average across all datasets in terms of R@10 and N@10 respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[KGUF: Simple Knowledge-aware Graph-based Recommender with User-based Semantic Features Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20095v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into recommendation has led to a novel family of Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, namely Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF). Following the same GNNs wave, recommender systems exploiting Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have also been successfully empowered by the GCF rationale to combine the representational power of GNNs with the semantics conveyed by KGs, giving rise to Knowledge-aware Graph Collaborative Filtering (KGCF), which use KGs to mine hidden user intent. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that computing and combining user-level intent might not always be necessary, as simpler approaches can yield comparable or superior results while keeping explicit semantic features. Under this perspective, user historical preferences become essential to refine the KG and retain the most discriminating features, thus leading to concise item representation. Driven by the assumptions above, we propose KGUF, a KGCF model that learns latent representations of semantic features in the KG to better define the item profile. By leveraging user profiles through decision trees, KGUF effectively retains only those features relevant to users. Results on three datasets justify KGUF's rationale, as our approach is able to reach performance comparable or superior to SOTA methods while maintaining a simpler formalization.

| **[Beyond the Known: Novel Class Discovery for Open-world Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19907v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification on graphs is of great importance in many applications. Due to the limited labeling capability and evolution in real-world open scenarios, novel classes can emerge on unlabeled testing nodes. However, little attention has been paid to novel class discovery on graphs. Discovering novel classes is challenging as novel and known class nodes are correlated by edges, which makes their representations indistinguishable when applying message passing GNNs. Furthermore, the novel classes lack labeling information to guide the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel method Open-world gRAph neuraL network (ORAL) to tackle these challenges. ORAL first detects correlations between classes through semi-supervised prototypical learning. Inter-class correlations are subsequently eliminated by the prototypical attention network, leading to distinctive representations for different classes. Furthermore, to fully explore multi-scale graph features for alleviating label deficiencies, ORAL generates pseudo-labels by aligning and ensembling label estimations from multiple stacked prototypical attention networks. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p></details> |  |

Integrating diverse data types can improve the accuracy and reliability of cancer diagnosis and treatment. There can be disease-related information that is too subtle for humans or existing technological tools to discern visually. Traditional methods typically focus on partial or unimodal information about biological systems at individual scales and fail to encapsulate the complete spectrum of the heterogeneous nature of data. Deep neural networks have facilitated the development of sophisticated multimodal data fusion approaches that can extract and integrate relevant information from multiple sources. Recent deep learning frameworks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown remarkable success in multimodal learning. This review article provides an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art in GNNs and Transformers for multimodal data fusion in oncology settings, highlighting notable research studies and their findings. We also discuss the foundations of multimodal learning, inherent challenges, and opportunities for integrative learning in oncology. By examining the current state and potential future developments of multimodal data integration in oncology, we aim to demonstrate the promising role that multimodal neural networks can play in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment through informed oncology practices in personalized settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attending to Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04181v3)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, transformer architectures for graphs emerged as an alternative to established techniques for machine learning with graphs, such as (message-passing) graph neural networks. So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing. Further, we outline open challenges and research direction to stimulate future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/luis-mueller/probing-graph-transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Yet, to date, no model with polynomial complexity is known to be complete, that is, able to distinguish between any pair of non-isomorphic point clouds. We fill this theoretical gap by showing that point clouds can be completely determined, up to permutation and rigid motion, by applying the 3-WL graph isomorphism test to the point cloud's centralized Gram matrix. Moreover, we formulate an Euclidean variant of the 2-WL test and show that it is also sufficient to achieve completeness. We then show how our complete Euclidean WL tests can be simulated by an Euclidean graph neural network of moderate size and demonstrate their separation capability on highly symmetrical point clouds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

The alignment between 3D scene graphs is the first step of many downstream tasks such as scene graph aided point cloud registration, mosaicking, overlap checking, and robot navigation. In this work, we treat 3D scene graph alignment as a partial graph-matching problem and propose to solve it with a graph neural network. We reuse the geometric features learned by a point cloud registration method and associate the clustered point-level geometric features with the node-level semantic feature via our designed feature fusion module. Partial matching is enabled by using a learnable method to select the top-k similar node pairs. Subsequent downstream tasks such as point cloud registration are achieved by running a pre-trained registration network within the matched regions. We further propose a point-matching rescoring method, that uses the node-wise alignment of the 3D scene graph to reweight the matching candidates from a pre-trained point cloud registration method. It reduces the false point correspondences estimated especially in low-overlapping cases. Experiments show that our method improves the alignment accuracy by 10~20% in low-overlap and random transformation scenarios and outperforms the existing work in multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

The existing configuration space for these materials is wide, while existing molecular simulation methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a model which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster at adsorption properties compared to molecular simulations. To validate the model, we generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR, MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be used for property prediction. Furthermore, we show that the model can be used for identifying adsorption sites. Finally, we evaluate the capability of our model for generating novel zeolite configurations by using it in combination with a genetic algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Individual Graph Structures to Enhance Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19442v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving field of psychopathology, the accurate assessment and forecasting of data derived from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is crucial. EMA offers contextually-rich psychopathological measurements over time, that practically lead to Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. Thus, many challenges arise in analysis from the temporal complexities inherent in emotional, behavioral, and contextual EMA data as well as their inter-dependencies. To address both of these aspects, this research investigates the performance of Recurrent and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Overall, GNNs, by incorporating additional information from graphs reflecting the inner relationships between the variables, notably enhance the results by decreasing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 0.84 compared to the baseline LSTM model at 1.02. Therefore, the effect of constructing graphs with different characteristics on GNN performance is also explored. Additionally, GNN-learned graphs, which are dynamically refined during the training process, were evaluated. Using such graphs showed a similarly good performance. Thus, graph learning proved also promising for other GNN methods, potentially refining the pre-defined graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops</p></details> |
| **[On the Two Sides of Redundancy in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04190v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks iteratively generate node embeddings by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. With increasing depth, information from more distant nodes is included. However, node embeddings may be unable to represent the growing node neighborhoods accurately and the influence of distant nodes may vanish, a problem referred to as oversquashing. Information redundancy in message passing, i.e., the repetitive exchange and encoding of identical information amplifies oversquashing. We develop a novel aggregation scheme based on neighborhood trees, which allows for controlling redundancy by pruning redundant branches of unfolding trees underlying standard message passing. While the regular structure of unfolding trees allows the reuse of intermediate results in a straightforward way, the use of neighborhood trees poses computational challenges. We propose compact representations of neighborhood trees and merge them, exploiting computational redundancy by identifying isomorphic subtrees. From this, node and graph embeddings are computed via a neural architecture inspired by tree canonization techniques. Our method is less susceptible to oversquashing than traditional message passing neural networks and can improve the accuracy on widely used benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Power of the Weisfeiler-Leman Test for Graph Motif Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17053v3)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seminal research in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) has revealed a direct correspondence between the expressive capabilities of GNNs and the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$WL) test, a widely-recognized method for verifying graph isomorphism. This connection has reignited interest in comprehending the specific graph properties effectively distinguishable by the $k$WL test. A central focus of research in this field revolves around determining the least dimensionality $k$, for which $k$WL can discern graphs with different number of occurrences of a pattern graph $P$. We refer to such a least $k$ as the WL-dimension of this pattern counting problem. This inquiry traditionally delves into two distinct counting problems related to patterns: subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting. Intriguingly, despite their initial appearance as separate challenges with seemingly divergent approaches, both of these problems are interconnected components of a more comprehensive problem: "graph motif parameters". In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the WL-dimension of labeled graph motif parameters. As specific instances of this result, we obtain characterizations of the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting problem for every labeled pattern $P$. We additionally demonstrate that in cases where the $k$WL test distinguishes between graphs with varying occurrences of a pattern $P$, the exact number of occurrences of $P$ can be computed uniformly using only local information of the last layer of a corresponding GNN. We finally delve into the challenge of recognizing the WL-dimension of various graph parameters. We give a polynomial time algorithm for determining the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting problem for given pattern $P$, answering an open question from previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Treatment Effect Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19289v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited labeled samples to reduce experimental risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recommender Systems: A Strategy to Mitigate False Negative Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13912v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In implicit collaborative filtering (CF) task of recommender systems, recent works mainly focus on model structure design with promising techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). Effective and efficient negative sampling methods that suit these models, however, remain underdeveloped. One challenge is that existing hard negative samplers tend to suffer from severer over-fitting in model training. In this work, we first study the reason behind the over-fitting, and illustrate it with the incorrect selection of false negative instances with the support of experiments. In addition, we empirically observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon, that is, polluting hard negative samples' embeddings with a quite large proportional of positive samples' embeddings will lead to remarkable performance gains for prediction accuracy. On top of this finding, we present a novel negative sampling strategy, i.e., positive-dominated negative synthesizing (PDNS). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis and derive a simple equivalent algorithm of PDNS, where only a soft factor is added in the loss function. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 9 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18479v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are currently one of the most performant collaborative filtering methods. Meanwhile, owing to the use of an embedding table to represent each user/item as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommenders have inherited the long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a common practice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewer embedding vectors (i.e., meta-embeddings). When assigning meta-embeddings, most existing methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each user's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifying the optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, in the context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omits the semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-item interaction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To this end, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering (LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-based recommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an extra learnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these two heavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings by minimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignment update by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding its closed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse. The meta-embeddings and assignment matrix are alternately updated, where the latter is sparsified on the fly to ensure negligible storage overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have verified LEGCF's smallest trade-off between size and performance, with consistent accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. The codebase of LEGCF is available in https://github.com/xurong-liang/LEGCF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR '24</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tailored for radio resource management by presenting a new architecture: the Low Rank Message Passing Graph Neural Network (LR-MPGNN). The cornerstone of LR-MPGNN is the implementation of a low-rank approximation technique that substitutes the conventional linear layers with their low-rank counterparts. This innovative design significantly reduces the model size and the number of parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed LR-MPGNN model based on several key metrics: model size, number of parameters, weighted sum rate of the communication system, and the distribution of eigenvalues of weight matrices. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the LR-MPGNN model achieves a sixtyfold decrease in model size, and the number of model parameters can be reduced by up to 98%. Performance-wise, the LR-MPGNN demonstrates robustness with a marginal 2% reduction in the best-case scenario in the normalized weighted sum rate compared to the original MPGNN model. Additionally, the distribution of eigenvalues of the weight matrices in the LR-MPGNN model is more uniform and spans a wider range, suggesting a strategic redistribution of weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by the tinyML Research Symposium 2024</p></details> |
| **[Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02861v4)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-level anomaly detection has gained significant attention as it finds applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the spectral properties of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we re-investigate the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient, indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN that explores the inherent spectral features of anomalous graphs for graph-level anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework with two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN outperforms the best rival by 6.74% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44% in AUC, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Furthermore, to realize the aspirations of precision medicine in identifying and adjusting treatments for patients depending on the therapeutic response, there is a need for building tumor dynamic models that can integrate both longitudinal tumor size as well as multimodal, high-content data. In this work, we take a step towards enhancing personalized tumor dynamic predictions by proposing a heterogeneous graph encoder that utilizes a bipartite Graph Convolutional Neural network (GCN) combined with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural-ODEs). We applied the methodology to a large collection of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) data, spanning a wide variety of treatments (as well as their combinations) on tumors that originated from a number of different organs. We first show that the methodology is able to discover a tumor dynamic model that significantly improves upon an empirical model which is in current use. Additionally, we show that the graph encoder is able to effectively utilize multimodal data to enhance tumor predictions. Our findings indicate that the methodology holds significant promise and offers potential applications in pre-clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

As 70% of the world's population will likely live in urban environments in 2050, efficient simulation and planning tools for WDS play a crucial role in reaching UN's sustainable developmental goal (SDG) 6 - "Clean water and sanitation for all". In this realm, we propose a novel and efficient machine learning emulator, more precisely, a physics-informed deep learning (DL) model, for hydraulic state estimation in WDS. Using a recursive approach, our model only needs a few graph convolutional neural network (GCN) layers and employs an innovative algorithm based on message passing. Unlike conventional machine learning tasks, the model uses hydraulic principles to infer two additional hydraulic state features in the process of reconstructing the available ground truth feature in an unsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DL approach to emulate the popular hydraulic simulator EPANET, utilizing no additional information. Like most DL models and unlike the hydraulic simulator, our model demonstrates vastly faster emulation times that do not increase drastically with the size of the WDS. Moreover, we achieve high accuracy on the ground truth and very similar results compared to the hydraulic simulator as demonstrated through experiments on five real-world WDS datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper with the same title published at Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2024</p></details> |

Most methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on generating post-hoc explanations rather than taking an intrinsic approach, the latter characterizing an interpretable model. In this work, we introduce an interpretable approach for graph-based VQA and demonstrate competitive performance on the GQA dataset. This approach bridges the gap between interpretability and performance. Our model is designed to intrinsically produce a subgraph during the question-answering process as its explanation, providing insight into the decision making. To evaluate the quality of these generated subgraphs, we compare them against established post-hoc explainability methods for graph neural networks, and perform a human evaluation. Moreover, we present quantitative metrics that correlate with the evaluations of human assessors, acting as automatic metrics for the generated explanatory subgraphs. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/Intrinsic-Subgraph-Generation-for-VQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

However, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERTA: A High-Efficiency and Rigorous Training Algorithm for Unfolded Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18142v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a variant of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Unfolded GNNs offer enhanced interpretability and flexibility over traditional designs. Nevertheless, they still suffer from scalability challenges when it comes to the training cost. Although many methods have been proposed to address the scalability issues, they mostly focus on per-iteration efficiency, without worst-case convergence guarantees. Moreover, those methods typically add components to or modify the original model, thus possibly breaking the interpretability of Unfolded GNNs. In this paper, we propose HERTA: a High-Efficiency and Rigorous Training Algorithm for Unfolded GNNs that accelerates the whole training process, achieving a nearly-linear time worst-case training guarantee. Crucially, HERTA converges to the optimum of the original model, thus preserving the interpretability of Unfolded GNNs. Additionally, as a byproduct of HERTA, we propose a new spectral sparsification method applicable to normalized and regularized graph Laplacians that ensures tighter bounds for our algorithm than existing spectral sparsifiers do. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the superiority of HERTA as well as its adaptability to various loss functions and optimizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing GNNs: Explanation-Based Identification of Backdoored Training Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18136v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in numerous domains, yet they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that can compromise their performance and ethical application. The detection of these attacks is crucial for maintaining the reliability and security of GNN classification tasks, but effective detection techniques are lacking. Following an initial investigation, we observed that while graph-level explanations can offer limited insights, their effectiveness in detecting backdoor triggers is inconsistent and incomplete. To bridge this gap, we extract and transform secondary outputs of GNN explanation mechanisms, designing seven novel metrics that more effectively detect backdoor attacks. Additionally, we develop an adaptive attack to rigorously evaluate our approach. We test our method on multiple benchmark datasets and examine its efficacy against various attack models. Our results show that our method can achieve high detection performance, marking a significant advancement in safeguarding GNNs against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</p></details> |  |

However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable $k$-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

| **[Neural Attributed Community Search at Billion Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18874v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community search has been extensively studied in the past decades. In recent years, there is a growing interest in attributed community search that aims to identify a community based on both the query nodes and query attributes. A set of techniques have been investigated. Though the recent methods based on advanced learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, we notice that 1) they suffer from severe efficiency issues; 2) they directly model community search as a node classification problem and thus cannot make good use of interdependence among different entities in the graph. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a new neurAL attrIbuted Community sEarch model for large-scale graphs, termed ALICE. ALICE first extracts a candidate subgraph to reduce the search scope and subsequently predicts the community by the Consistency-aware Net , termed ConNet. Specifically, in the extraction phase, we introduce the density sketch modularity that uses a unified form to combine the strengths of two existing powerful modularities, i.e., classical modularity and density modularity. Based on the new modularity metric, we first adaptively obtain the candidate subgraph, formed by the k-hop neighbors of the query nodes, with the maximum modularity. Then, we construct a node-attribute bipartite graph to take attributes into consideration. After that, ConNet adopts a cross-attention encoder to encode the interaction between the query and the graph. The training of the model is guided by the structure-attribute consistency and the local consistency to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments over 11 real-world datasets including one billion-scale graph demonstrate the superiority of ALICE in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CANOS: A Fast and Scalable Neural AC-OPF Solver Robust To N-1 Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17660v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) refers to a wide range of related optimization problems with the goal of operating power systems efficiently and securely. In the simplest setting, OPF determines how much power to generate in order to minimize costs while meeting demand for power and satisfying physical and operational constraints. In even the simplest case, power grid operators use approximations of the AC-OPF problem because solving the exact problem is prohibitively slow with state-of-the-art solvers. These approximations sacrifice accuracy and operational feasibility in favor of speed. This trade-off leads to costly "uplift payments" and increased carbon emissions, especially for large power grids. In the present work, we train a deep learning system (CANOS) to predict near-optimal solutions (within 1% of the true AC-OPF cost) without compromising speed (running in as little as 33--65 ms). Importantly, CANOS scales to realistic grid sizes with promising empirical results on grids containing as many as 10,000 buses. Finally, because CANOS is a Graph Neural Network, it is robust to changes in topology. We show that CANOS is accurate across N-1 topological perturbations of a base grid typically used in security-constrained analysis. This paves the way for more efficient optimization of more complex OPF problems which alter grid connectivity such as unit commitment, topology optimization and security-constrained OPF.</p></details> |  |

However, the abundance of MLFF models and the challenge of accurately predicting atomic forces pose significant obstacles in their practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning framework, EL-MLFFs, which leverages the stacking method to integrate predictions from diverse MLFFs and enhance force prediction accuracy. By constructing a graph representation of molecular structures and employing a graph neural network (GNN) as the meta-model, EL-MLFFs effectively captures atomic interactions and refines force predictions. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: methane molecules and methanol adsorbed on a Cu(100) surface. The results demonstrate that EL-MLFFs significantly improves force prediction accuracy compared to individual MLFFs, with the ensemble of all eight models yielding the best performance. Moreover, our ablation study highlights the crucial roles of the residual network and graph attention layers in the model's architecture. The EL-MLFFs framework offers a promising solution to the challenges of model selection and force prediction accuracy in MLFFs, paving the way for more reliable and efficient molecular simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Variational Graph Auto-Encoder Based Inductive Learning Method for Semi-Supervised Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17500v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning is a fundamental research issue in various domains of applications, of which the inductive learning problem is particularly challenging as it requires models to generalize to unseen graph structures during inference. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful graph models for inductive learning tasks such as node classification, whereas they typically heavily rely on the annotated nodes under a fully supervised training setting. Compared with the GNN-based methods, variational graph auto-encoders (VGAEs) are known to be more generalizable to capture the internal structural information of graphs independent of node labels and have achieved prominent performance on multiple unsupervised learning tasks. However, so far there is still a lack of work focusing on leveraging the VGAE framework for inductive learning, due to the difficulties in training the model in a supervised manner and avoiding over-fitting the proximity information of graphs. To solve these problems and improve the model performance of VGAEs for inductive graph representation learning, in this work, we propose the Self-Label Augmented VGAE model. To leverage the label information for training, our model takes node labels as one-hot encoded inputs and then performs label reconstruction in model training. To overcome the scarcity problem of node labels for semi-supervised settings, we further propose the Self-Label Augmentation Method (SLAM), which uses pseudo labels generated by our model with a node-wise masking approach to enhance the label information. Experiments on benchmark inductive learning graph datasets verify that our proposed model archives promising results on node classification with particular superiority under semi-supervised learning settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Implicit GNN Solver for Poisson-like problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10891v3)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\Psi$-GNN, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for solving the ubiquitous Poisson PDE problems with mixed boundary conditions. By leveraging the Implicit Layer Theory, $\Psi$-GNN models an "infinitely" deep network, thus avoiding the empirical tuning of the number of required Message Passing layers to attain the solution. Its original architecture explicitly takes into account the boundary conditions, a critical prerequisite for physical applications, and is able to adapt to any initially provided solution. $\Psi$-GNN is trained using a "physics-informed" loss, and the training process is stable by design, and insensitive to its initialization. Furthermore, the consistency of the approach is theoretically proven, and its flexibility and generalization efficiency are experimentally demonstrated: the same learned model can accurately handle unstructured meshes of various sizes, as well as different boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, $\Psi$-GNN is the first physics-informed GNN-based method that can handle various unstructured domains, boundary conditions and initial solutions while also providing convergence guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[AFDGCF: Adaptive Feature De-correlation Graph Collaborative Filtering for Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17416v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed significant success in recommender systems (RS), capitalizing on their ability to capture collaborative signals within intricate user-item relationships via message-passing mechanisms. However, these GNN-based RS inadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and item embeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations. While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothing problem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of the over-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representations and subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlation issue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact of over-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is a significant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlation issue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empirical evidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in these models. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes a pivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Adaptive Feature De-correlation Graph Collaborative Filtering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically applies correlation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix, effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. The efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filtering models across four publicly available datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel modeling architecture called BrainRGIN for predicting intelligence (fluid, crystallized, and total intelligence) using graph neural networks on rsfMRI derived static functional network connectivity matrices. Extending from the existing graph convolution networks, our approach incorporates a clustering-based embedding and graph isomorphism network in the graph convolutional layer to reflect the nature of the brain sub-network organization and efficient network expression, in combination with TopK pooling and attention-based readout functions. We evaluated our proposed architecture on a large dataset, specifically the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset, and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting individual differences in intelligence. Our model achieved lower mean squared errors and higher correlation scores than existing relevant graph architectures and other traditional machine learning models for all of the intelligence prediction tasks. The middle frontal gyrus exhibited a significant contribution to both fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting their pivotal role in these cognitive processes. Total composite scores identified a diverse set of brain regions to be relevant which underscores the complex nature of total intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Real-world protein structures are dynamic, which will determine the properties of proteins. However, the existing machine learning methods, like ProNet (Wang et al., 2022a), only access limited conformational characteristics and protein side-chain features, leading to impractical protein structure and inaccuracy of protein classes in their predictions. In this paper, we propose novel semantic data augmentation methods, Novel Augmentation of New Node Attributes (NaNa), and Molecular Interactions and Geometric Upgrading (MiGu) to incorporate backbone chemical and side-chain biophysical information into protein classification tasks and a co-embedding residual learning framework. Specifically, we leverage molecular biophysical, secondary structure, chemical bonds, and ionic features of proteins to facilitate protein classification tasks. Furthermore, our semantic augmentation methods and the co-embedding residual learning framework can improve the performance of GIN (Xu et al., 2019) on EC and Fold datasets (Bairoch, 2000; Andreeva et al., 2007) by 16.41% and 11.33% respectively.

HOGANN integrates dynamic intrinsic functional brain networks, estimated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), using long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture temporal network dynamics. We employ a high-order attention module for information fusion and message passing among neighboring nodes, enhancing the network community analysis. Our model is validated across two distinct data cohorts, yielding substantially higher classification accuracy than benchmark algorithms. Furthermore, we discern the most pertinent subnetworks and cognitive regions affected by persistent marijuana consumption, indicating adverse effects on functional brain networks, particularly within the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Intriguingly, our model demonstrates superior performance in cohorts exhibiting prolonged dependence, implying that prolonged marijuana usage induces more pronounced alterations in brain networks. The model proficiently identifies craving brain maps, thereby delineating critical brain regions for analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection with a novel graph neural network approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16206v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spread of rumors on social media has caused a negative impact on people's daily life, leading to potential panic, fear, and mental health problems for the public. How to debunk rumors as early as possible remains a challenging problem. Existing studies mainly leverage information propagation structure to detect rumors, while very few works focus on correlation among users that they may coordinate to spread rumors in order to gain large popularity. In this paper, we propose a new detection model, that jointly learns both the representations of user correlation and information propagation to detect rumors on social media. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks to learn the representations of user correlation from a bipartite graph that describes the correlations between users and source tweets, and the representations of information propagation with a tree structure. Then we combine the learned representations from these two modules to classify the rumors. Since malicious users intend to subvert our model after deployment, we further develop a greedy attack scheme to analyze the cost of three adversarial attacks: graph attack, comment attack, and joint attack. Evaluation results on two public datasets illustrate that the proposed MODEL outperforms the state-of-the-art rumor detection models. We also demonstrate our method performs well for early rumor detection. Moreover, the proposed detection method is more robust to adversarial attacks compared to the best existing method. Importantly, we show that it requires a high cost for attackers to subvert user correlation pattern, demonstrating the importance of considering user correlation for rumor detection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Current studies on graph heterophily mainly focus on aggregation calibration or neighbor extension and address the heterophily issue by utilizing node features or structural information to improve GNN representations. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that the valuable semantic information inherent in heterophily can be utilized effectively in graph learning by investigating the distribution of neighbors for each individual node within the graph. The theoretical analysis is carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the idea in enhancing graph learning. Based on this analysis, we propose HiGNN, an innovative approach that constructs an additional new graph structure, that integrates heterophilous information by leveraging node distribution to enhance connectivity between nodes that share similar semantic characteristics. We conduct empirical assessments on node classification tasks using both homophilous and heterophilous benchmark datasets and compare HiGNN to popular GNN baselines and SoTA methods, confirming the effectiveness in improving graph representations. In addition, by incorporating heterophilous information, we demonstrate a notable enhancement in existing GNN-based approaches, and the homophily degree across real-world datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the efficiency of utilizing anatomical, physiological, or molecular characteristics of neurons is relatively low and costly. With the advancements in electron microscopy imaging and analysis techniques for brain tissue, we are able to obtain whole-brain connectome consisting neuronal high-resolution morphology and connectivity information. However, few models are built based on such data for automated neuron classification. In this paper, we propose NeuNet, a framework that combines morphological information of neurons obtained from skeleton and topological information between neurons obtained from neural circuit. Specifically, NeuNet consists of three components, namely Skeleton Encoder, Connectome Encoder, and Readout Layer. Skeleton Encoder integrates the local information of neurons in a bottom-up manner, with a one-dimensional convolution in neural skeleton's point data; Connectome Encoder uses a graph neural network to capture the topological information of neural circuit; finally, Readout Layer fuses the above two information and outputs classification results. We reprocess and release two new datasets for neuron classification task from volume electron microscopy(VEM) images of human brain cortex and Drosophila brain. Experiments on these two datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our model with accuracy of 0.9169 and 0.9363, respectively.

| **[Learning Flexible Body Collision Dynamics with Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12467v3)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many mesh-based graph neural network (GNN) models have been proposed for modeling complex high-dimensional physical systems. Remarkable achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i) reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics. However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur within a very short timeframe. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which uses hierarchical mesh structures and can learn long-range dependencies (occurred by collisions) among spatially distant positions of a body -- two close positions in a higher-level mesh correspond to two distant positions in a lower-level mesh. HCMT enables long-range interactions, and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision effects to faraway positions. To this end, it consists of a contact mesh Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer (CMT and HMT, respectively). Lastly, we propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that HCMT provides significant performance improvements over existing methods.

However, beam training in multiuser XL-MIMO systems is challenging. To tackle these issues, we conceive a three-phase graph neural network (GNN)-based beam training scheme for multiuser XL-MIMO systems. In the first phase, only far-field wide beams have to be tested for each user and the GNN is utilized to map the beamforming gain information of the far-field wide beams to the optimal near-field beam for each user. In addition, the proposed GNN-based scheme can exploit the position-correlation between adjacent users for further improvement of the accuracy of beam training. In the second phase, a beam allocation scheme based on the probability vectors produced at the outputs of GNNs is proposed to address the above beam-direction conflicts between users. In the third phase, the hybrid TBF is designed for further reducing the inter-user interference. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the beam training performance of the benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed beam training scheme approaches that of an exhaustive search, despite requiring only about 7% of the pilot overhead.</p></details> | submitted to IEEE |
| **[Manufacturing Service Capability Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17239v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current landscape, the predominant methods for identifying manufacturing capabilities from manufacturers rely heavily on keyword matching and semantic matching. However, these methods often fall short by either overlooking valuable hidden information or misinterpreting critical data. Consequently, such approaches result in an incomplete identification of manufacturers' capabilities. This underscores the pressing need for data-driven solutions to enhance the accuracy and completeness of manufacturing capability identification. To address the need, this study proposes a Graph Neural Network-based method for manufacturing service capability identification over a knowledge graph. To enhance the identification performance, this work introduces a novel approach that involves aggregating information from the graph nodes' neighborhoods as well as oversampling the graph data, which can be effectively applied across a wide range of practical scenarios. Evaluations conducted on a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph and subsequent ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach. This study not only contributes a innovative method for inferring manufacturing service capabilities but also significantly augments the quality of Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graphs.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced the capabilities of generative models in 2D animation. In this work, we directly utilize these models within the 3D domain to achieve controllable and high-fidelity 4D facial animation. By integrating the strengths of diffusion processes and geometric deep learning, we employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as denoising diffusion models in a novel approach, formulating the diffusion process directly on the mesh space and enabling the generation of 3D facial expressions. This facilitates the generation of facial deformations through a mesh-diffusion-based model. Additionally, to ensure temporal coherence in our animations, we propose a consistent noise sampling method. Under a series of both quantitative and qualitative experiments, we showcase that the proposed method outperforms prior work in 4D expression synthesis by generating high-fidelity extreme expressions. Furthermore, we applied our method to textured 4D facial expression generation, implementing a straightforward extension that involves training on a large-scale textured 4D facial expression database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Crowd-Aware Multi-Agent Path Finding through Local Broadcasting with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10275v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Less Is More -- On the Importance of Sparsification for Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17159v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the recent studies tackling routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with machine learning use a transformer or Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoder architecture. However, many of them apply these encoders naively by allowing them to aggregate information over the whole TSP instances. We, on the other hand, propose a data preprocessing method that allows the encoders to focus on the most relevant parts of the TSP instances only. In particular, we propose graph sparsification for TSP graph representations passed to GNNs and attention masking for TSP instances passed to transformers where the masks correspond to the adjacency matrices of the sparse TSP graph representations. Furthermore, we propose ensembles of different sparsification levels allowing models to focus on the most promising parts while also allowing information flow between all nodes of a TSP instance. In the experimental studies, we show that for GNNs appropriate sparsification and ensembles of different sparsification levels lead to substantial performance increases of the overall architecture. We also design a new, state-of-the-art transformer encoder with ensembles of attention masking. These transformers increase model performance from a gap of $0.16\%$ to $0.10\%$ for TSP instances of size 100 and from $0.02\%$ to $0.00\%$ for TSP instances of size 50.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML framework that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively, to match their algorithmic nature. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems. Our work provides useful recommendations for software, system and hardware designers. PyGim will be open-sourced to enable the widespread use of PIM systems in GNNs.</p></details> |  |

While state-of-the-art CPUs and GPUs feature high computing power, the Standard GNN training protocol adopted in existing GNN frameworks cannot efficiently utilize the platform resources. To this end, we propose a novel Unified CPU-GPU protocol that can improve the resource utilization of GNN training on a CPU-GPU platform. The Unified CPU-GPU protocol instantiates multiple GNN training processes in parallel on both the CPU and the GPU. By allocating training processes on the CPU to perform GNN training collaboratively with the GPU, the proposed protocol improves the platform resource utilization and reduces the CPU-GPU data transfer overhead. Since the performance of a CPU and a GPU varies, we develop a novel load balancer that balances the workload dynamically between CPUs and GPUs during runtime. We evaluate our protocol using two representative GNN sampling algorithms, with two widely-used GNN models, on three datasets. Compared with the standard training protocol adopted in the state-of-the-art GNN frameworks, our protocol effectively improves resource utilization and overall training time. On a platform where the GPU moderately outperforms the CPU, our protocol speeds up GNN training by up to 1.41x. On a platform where the GPU significantly outperforms the CPU, our protocol speeds up GNN training by up to 1.26x. Our protocol is open-sourced and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art GNN frameworks and accelerate GNN training. Our protocol particularly benefits those with limited GPU access due to its high demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 21st ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers (CF' 24)</p></details> |

Counterfactual explanations, crucial for understanding model decisions, examine how input graph changes affect outcomes. This paper introduces two novel counterfactual explanation methods for TGNNs: GreeDy (Greedy Explainer for Dynamic Graphs) and CoDy (Counterfactual Explainer for Dynamic Graphs). They treat explanations as a search problem, seeking input graph alterations that alter model predictions. GreeDy uses a simple, greedy approach, while CoDy employs a sophisticated Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. Experiments show both methods effectively generate clear explanations. Notably, CoDy outperforms GreeDy and existing factual methods, with up to 59\% higher success rate in finding significant counterfactual inputs. This highlights CoDy's potential in clarifying TGNN decision-making, increasing their transparency and trustworthiness in practice.</p></details> |  |

Various texts such as biomedical literature, drug reviews, and user posts on social media and medical forums contain a wealth of information about ADEs. Recent studies have applied word embedding and deep learning -based natural language processing to automate ADE detection from text. However, they did not explore incorporating explicit medical knowledge about drugs and adverse reactions or the corresponding feature learning. This paper adopts the heterogenous text graph which describes relationships between documents, words and concepts, augments it with medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System, and proposes a concept-aware attention mechanism which learns features differently for the different types of nodes in the graph. We further utilize contextualized embeddings from pretrained language models and convolutional graph neural networks for effective feature representation and relational learning. Experiments on four public datasets show that our model achieves performance competitive to the recent advances and the concept-aware attention consistently outperforms other attention mechanisms.</p></details> | LREC-COLING 2024 |
| **[Graph Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16656v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph augmentation with contrastive learning has gained significant attention in the field of recommendation systems due to its ability to learn expressive user representations, even when labeled data is limited. However, directly applying existing GCL models to real-world recommendation environments poses challenges. There are two primary issues to address. Firstly, the lack of consideration for data noise in contrastive learning can result in noisy self-supervised signals, leading to degraded performance. Secondly, many existing GCL approaches rely on graph neural network (GNN) architectures, which can suffer from over-smoothing problems due to non-adaptive message passing. To address these challenges, we propose a principled framework called GraphAug. This framework introduces a robust data augmentor that generates denoised self-supervised signals, enhancing recommender systems. The GraphAug framework incorporates a graph information bottleneck (GIB)-regularized augmentation paradigm, which automatically distills informative self-supervision information and adaptively adjusts contrastive view generation. Through rigorous experimentation on real-world datasets, we thoroughly assessed the performance of our novel GraphAug model. The outcomes consistently unveil its superiority over existing baseline methods.

However, due to structural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic flow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and periodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the key temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a compact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN (Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively considering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow. First, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked subseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context in a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and contextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series. Then, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by using stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are extracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making time-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn fine-grained short-term temporal features. Finally, LSTTN fuses the long-term trend, periodic features and short-term features to obtain the prediction results. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that in 60-minute-ahead long-term forecasting, the LSTTN model achieves a minimum improvement of 5.63\% and a maximum improvement of 16.78\% over baseline models.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representation learning on graphs, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, GNNs have several drawbacks such as lacking interpretability, can easily inherit the bias of data and cannot model casual relations. Recently, counterfactual learning on graphs has shown promising results in alleviating these drawbacks. Various approaches have been proposed for counterfactual fairness, explainability, link prediction and other applications on graphs. To facilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we categorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning. We divide existing methods into four categories based on problems studied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a general framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these works. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of graph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To offer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a collection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a ``one-stop-shop'' for building a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories and current resources.

However, graph Transformer generally treats nodes as tokens, which results in quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes during self-attention computation. The graph MLP Mixer addresses this challenge by using the efficient MLP Mixer technique from computer vision. However, the time-consuming process of extracting graph tokens limits its performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named ChebMixer, a newly graph MLP Mixer that uses fast Chebyshev polynomials-based spectral filtering to extract a sequence of tokens. Firstly, we produce multiscale representations of graph nodes via fast Chebyshev polynomial-based spectral filtering. Next, we consider each node's multiscale representations as a sequence of tokens and refine the node representation with an effective MLP Mixer. Finally, we aggregate the multiscale representations of nodes through Chebyshev interpolation. Owing to the powerful representation capabilities and fast computational properties of MLP Mixer, we can quickly extract more informative node representations to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The experimental results prove our significant improvements in a variety of scenarios ranging from graph node classification to medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the addition of convolutional layers to combine the feature extraction power of convolutional networks with the computational efficiency of SNNs has been introduced. This paper studies the feasibility of using a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) to detect anticipatory slow cortical potentials (SCPs) related to braking intention in human participants using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Data was collected during an experiment wherein participants operated a remote-controlled vehicle on a testbed designed to simulate an urban environment. Participants were alerted to an incoming braking event via an audio countdown to elicit anticipatory potentials that were measured using an EEG. The CSNN's performance was compared to a standard CNN, EEGNet and three graph neural networks via 10-fold cross-validation. The CSNN outperformed all the other neural networks, and had a predictive accuracy of 99.06 percent with a true positive rate of 98.50 percent, a true negative rate of 99.20 percent and an F1-score of 0.98. Performance of the CSNN was comparable to the CNN in an ablation study using a subset of EEG channels that localized SCPs. Classification performance of the CSNN degraded only slightly when the floating-point EEG data were converted into spike trains via delta modulation to mimic synaptic connections.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Scientific Reports submission</p></details> |

Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned IK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize -- a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations for a local optimization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics, June 2023</p></details> |

However, existing algorithms often compromise on performance, resulting in a significant deterioration compared to their descriptor-based counterparts. In this paper, we introduce DGC-GNN, a novel algorithm that employs a global-to-local Graph Neural Network (GNN) that progressively exploits geometric and color cues to represent keypoints, thereby improving matching accuracy. Our procedure encodes both Euclidean and angular relations at a coarse level, forming the geometric embedding to guide the point matching. We evaluate DGC-GNN on both indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating that it not only doubles the accuracy of the state-of-the-art visual descriptor-free algorithm but also substantially narrows the performance gap between descriptor-based and descriptor-free methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[FreshGNN: Reducing Memory Access via Stable Historical Embeddings for Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07482v3)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key performance bottleneck when training graph neural network (GNN) models on large, real-world graphs is loading node features onto a GPU. Due to limited GPU memory, expensive data movement is necessary to facilitate the storage of these features on alternative devices with slower access (e.g. CPU memory). Moreover, the irregularity of graph structures contributes to poor data locality which further exacerbates the problem. Consequently, existing frameworks capable of efficiently training large GNN models usually incur a significant accuracy degradation because of the currently-available shortcuts involved. To address these limitations, we instead propose FreshGNN, a general-purpose GNN mini-batch training framework that leverages a historical cache for storing and reusing GNN node embeddings instead of re-computing them through fetching raw features at every iteration. Critical to its success, the corresponding cache policy is designed, using a combination of gradient-based and staleness criteria, to selectively screen those embeddings which are relatively stable and can be cached, from those that need to be re-computed to reduce estimation errors and subsequent downstream accuracy loss.

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the structure and properties of graphs which may be used for pre-training, but we lack a systematic overview of self-supervised pre-training tasks from the perspective of graph knowledge. In this paper, we comprehensively survey and analyze the pre-training tasks of graph foundation models from a knowledge-based perspective, consisting of microscopic (nodes, links, etc) and macroscopic knowledge (clusters, global structure, etc). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and 25 pre-training tasks, as well as various downstream task adaptation strategies. Furthermore, an extensive list of the related papers with detailed metadata is provided at https://github.com/Newiz430/Pretext.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[SSHPool: The Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16133v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a novel local graph pooling method, namely the Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling (SSHPool), for graph classification. To this end, we commence by assigning the nodes of a sample graph into different clusters, resulting in a family of separated subgraphs. We individually employ a local graph convolution units as the local structure to further compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. Since these subgraphs are separated by different clusters and the structural information cannot be propagated between them, the local convolution operation can significantly avoid the over-smoothing problem arising in most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By hierarchically performing the proposed procedures on the resulting coarsened graph, the proposed SSHPool can effectively extract the hierarchical global feature of the original graph structure, encapsulating rich intrinsic structural characteristics. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end GNN framework associated with the proposed SSHPool module for graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model on real-world datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art GNN methods in terms of the classification accuracies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Neighbor Explainability for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08118v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a new field growing in the last few years. In this publication we address the problem of determining how important is each neighbor for the GNN when classifying a node and how to measure the performance for this specific task. To do this, various known explainability methods are reformulated to get the neighbor importance and four new metrics are presented. Our results show that there is almost no difference between the explanations provided by gradient-based techniques in the GNN domain. In addition, many explainability techniques failed to identify important neighbors when GNNs without self-loops are used.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with GNNs and Rules: An Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07942v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything Model for Road Network Graph Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16051v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SAM-Road, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for extracting large-scale, vectorized road network graphs from satellite imagery. To predict graph geometry, we formulate it as a dense semantic segmentation task, leveraging the inherent strengths of SAM. The image encoder of SAM is fine-tuned to produce probability masks for roads and intersections, from which the graph vertices are extracted via simple non-maximum suppression. To predict graph topology, we designed a lightweight transformer-based graph neural network, which leverages the SAM image embeddings to estimate the edge existence probabilities between vertices. Our approach directly predicts the graph vertices and edges for large regions without expensive and complex post-processing heuristics, and is capable of building complete road network graphs spanning multiple square kilometers in a matter of seconds. With its simple, straightforward, and minimalist design, SAM-Road achieves comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art method RNGDet++, while being 40 times faster on the City-scale dataset. We thus demonstrate the power of a foundational vision model when applied to a graph learning task. The code is available at https://github.com/htcr/sam_road.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node Classification via Semantic-Structural Attention-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16033v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data, also known as complex network data, is omnipresent across various domains and applications. Prior graph neural network models primarily focused on extracting task-specific structural features through supervised learning objectives, but they fell short in capturing the inherent semantic and structural features of the entire graph. In this paper, we introduce the semantic-structural attention-enhanced graph convolutional network (SSA-GCN), which not only models the graph structure but also extracts generalized unsupervised features to enhance vertex classification performance. The SSA-GCN's key contributions lie in three aspects: firstly, it derives semantic information through unsupervised feature extraction from a knowledge graph perspective; secondly, it obtains structural information through unsupervised feature extraction from a complex network perspective; and finally, it integrates these features through a cross-attention mechanism. By leveraging these features, we augment the graph convolutional network, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. Our experiments on the Cora and CiteSeer datasets demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by our proposed method. Furthermore, our approach also exhibits excellent accuracy under privacy settings, making it a robust and effective solution for graph data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Federated Parameter Aggregation Method for Node Classification Tasks with Different Graph Network Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16004v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, federated learning has become widely used in various classical machine learning fields because of its collaborative ability to train data from multiple sources without compromising privacy. However, in the area of graph neural networks, the nodes and network structures of graphs held by clients are different in many practical applications, and the aggregation method that directly shares model gradients cannot be directly applied to this scenario. Therefore, this work proposes a federated aggregation method FLGNN applied to various graph federation scenarios and investigates the aggregation effect of parameter sharing at each layer of the graph neural network model. The effectiveness of the federated aggregation method FLGNN is verified by experiments on real datasets. Additionally, for the privacy security of FLGNN, this paper designs membership inference attack experiments and differential privacy defense experiments. The results show that FLGNN performs good robustness, and the success rate of privacy theft is further reduced by adding differential privacy defense methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMC: Fast Training of GNNs via Subgraph Sampling with Provable Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00924v3)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods -- a promising class of mini-batch training techniques -- discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\it first} subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Migrate Demographic Group For Fair GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04212v2)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural networks (GNNs) have been applied in many scenarios due to the superior performance of graph learning. However, fairness is always ignored when designing GNNs. As a consequence, biased information in training data can easily affect vanilla GNNs, causing biased results toward particular demographic groups (divided by sensitive attributes, such as race and age). There have been efforts to address the fairness issue. However, existing fair techniques generally divide the demographic groups by raw sensitive attributes and assume that are fixed. The biased information correlated with raw sensitive attributes will run through the training process regardless of the implemented fair techniques. It is urgent to resolve this problem for training fair GNNs. To tackle this problem, we propose a brand new framework, FairMigration, which can dynamically migrate the demographic groups instead of keeping that fixed with raw sensitive attributes. FairMigration is composed of two training stages. In the first stage, the GNNs are initially optimized by personalized self-supervised learning, and the demographic groups are adjusted dynamically. In the second stage, the new demographic groups are frozen and supervised learning is carried out under the constraints of new demographic groups and adversarial training. Extensive experiments reveal that FairMigration balances model performance and fairness well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks can Recover the Hidden Features Solely from the Graph Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10956v4)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for graph learning problems. GNNs show strong empirical performance in many practical tasks. However, the theoretical properties have not been completely elucidated. In this paper, we investigate whether GNNs can exploit the graph structure from the perspective of the expressive power of GNNs. In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled by hidden (or latent) node features, which contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this framework is kNN graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further use the recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs can fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the experiments, we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can accurately recover the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | ICML 2023 |
| **[Learning for Transductive Threshold Calibration in Open-World Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12039v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep metric learning for visual recognition, the calibration of distance thresholds is crucial for achieving desired model performance in the true positive rates (TPR) or true negative rates (TNR). However, calibrating this threshold presents challenges in open-world scenarios, where the test classes can be entirely disjoint from those encountered during training. We define the problem of finding distance thresholds for a trained embedding model to achieve target performance metrics over unseen open-world test classes as open-world threshold calibration. Existing posthoc threshold calibration methods, reliant on inductive inference and requiring a calibration dataset with a similar distance distribution as the test data, often prove ineffective in open-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce OpenGCN, a Graph Neural Network-based transductive threshold calibration method with enhanced adaptability and robustness. OpenGCN learns to predict pairwise connectivity for the unlabeled test instances embedded in a graph to determine its TPR and TNR at various distance thresholds, allowing for transductive inference of the distance thresholds which also incorporates test-time information. Extensive experiments across open-world visual recognition benchmarks validate OpenGCN's superiority over existing posthoc calibration methods for open-world threshold calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascading Blackout Severity Prediction with Statistically-Augmented Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15363v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher variability in grid conditions, resulting from growing renewable penetration and increased incidence of extreme weather events, has increased the difficulty of screening for scenarios that may lead to catastrophic cascading failures. Traditional power-flow-based tools for assessing cascading blackout risk are too slow to properly explore the space of possible failures and load/generation patterns. We add to the growing literature of faster graph-neural-network (GNN)-based techniques, developing two novel techniques for the estimation of blackout magnitude from initial grid conditions. First we propose several methods for employing an initial classification step to filter out safe "non blackout" scenarios prior to magnitude estimation. Second, using insights from the statistical properties of cascading blackouts, we propose a method for facilitating non-local message passing in our GNN models. We validate these two approaches on a large simulated dataset, and show the potential of both to increase blackout size estimation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning High-level Semantic-Relational Concepts for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00401v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on SLAM extend their pose graphs with higher-level semantic concepts like Rooms exploiting relationships between them, to provide, not only a richer representation of the situation/environment but also to improve the accuracy of its estimation. Concretely, our previous work, Situational Graphs (S-Graphs+), a pioneer in jointly leveraging semantic relationships in the factor optimization process, relies on semantic entities such as Planes and Rooms, whose relationship is mathematically defined. Nevertheless, there is no unique approach to finding all the hidden patterns in lower-level factor-graphs that correspond to high-level concepts of different natures. It is currently tackled with ad-hoc algorithms, which limits its graph expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose an algorithm based on Graph Neural Networks for learning high-level semantic-relational concepts that can be inferred from the low-level factor graph. Given a set of mapped Planes our algorithm is capable of inferring Room entities relating to the Planes. Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility of our method, our algorithm can infer an additional semantic-relational concept, i.e. Wall, and its relationship with its Planes. We validate our method in both simulated and real datasets demonstrating improved performance over two baseline approaches. Furthermore, we integrate our method into the S-Graphs+ algorithm providing improved pose and map accuracy compared to the baseline while further enhancing the scene representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Oriented GNNs Training on Large Knowledge Graphs for Accurate and Efficient Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05752v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a heterogeneous graph encompassing a diverse range of node and edge types. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are popular for training machine learning tasks like node classification and link prediction on KGs. However, HGNN methods exhibit excessive complexity influenced by the KG's size, density, and the number of node and edge types. AI practitioners handcraft a subgraph of a KG G relevant to a specific task. We refer to this subgraph as a task-oriented subgraph (TOSG), which contains a subset of task-related node and edge types in G. Training the task using TOSG instead of G alleviates the excessive computation required for a large KG. Crafting the TOSG demands a deep understanding of the KG's structure and the task's objectives. Hence, it is challenging and time-consuming. This paper proposes KG-TOSA, an approach to automate the TOSG extraction for task-oriented HGNN training on a large KG. In KG-TOSA, we define a generic graph pattern that captures the KG's local and global structure relevant to a specific task. We explore different techniques to extract subgraphs matching our graph pattern: namely (i) two techniques sampling around targeted nodes using biased random walk or influence scores, and (ii) a SPARQL-based extraction method leveraging RDF engines' built-in indices. Hence, it achieves negligible preprocessing overhead compared to the sampling techniques. We develop a benchmark of real KGs of large sizes and various tasks for node classification and link prediction. Our experiments show that KG-TOSA helps state-of-the-art HGNN methods reduce training time and memory usage by up to 70% while improving the model performance, e.g., accuracy and inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,9 Figures, 3 Tables, ICDE:2024</p></details> |
| **[GTC: GNN-Transformer Co-contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15520v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the most powerful weapon for various graph tasks due to the message-passing mechanism's great local information aggregation ability. However, over-smoothing has always hindered GNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs, Transformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via multi-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more immunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, can we propose a novel framework to combine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information aggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate the over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a collaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC architecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node information from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive learning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize self-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch, we propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with GNN to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As far as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation learning to utilize both GNN and Transformer to collaboratively capture different view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning. The experiments on real datasets show that GTC exhibits superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Codes can be available at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/GTC.</p></details> |  |

The literature on GNN highlights the potential of this evolving research area and its widespread adoption in real-life applications. However, most of the approaches are either new in concept or derived from specific techniques. Therefore, the potential of more than one approach in hybrid form has not been studied extensively, which can be well utilized for sequenced data or static data together. We derive a hybrid approach based on two established techniques as generalized aggregation networks and topology adaptive graph convolution networks that solve our purpose to apply on both types of sequenced and static nature of data, effectively. The proposed method applies to both node and graph classification. Our empirical analysis reveals that the results are at par with literature results and better for handwritten strokes as sequenced data, where graph structures have not been explored.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables and 26 pages</p></details> |
| **[Simple Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14951v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burdensome training costs on large-scale graphs have aroused significant interest in graph condensation, which involves tuning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a small condensed graph for use on the large-scale original graph. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning key metrics between the condensed and original graphs, such as gradients, distribution and trajectory of GNNs, yielding satisfactory performance on downstream tasks. However, these complex metrics necessitate intricate computations and can potentially disrupt the optimization process of the condensation graph, making the condensation process highly demanding and unstable. Motivated by the recent success of simplified models in various fields, we propose a simplified approach to metric alignment in graph condensation, aiming to reduce unnecessary complexity inherited from GNNs. In our approach, we eliminate external parameters and exclusively retain the target condensed graph during the condensation process. Following the hierarchical aggregation principles of GNNs, we introduce the Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) framework, which aligns the condensed graph with the original graph from the input layer to the prediction layer, guided by a pre-trained Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) model on the original graph. As a result, both graphs possess the similar capability to train GNNs. This straightforward yet effective strategy achieves a significant speedup of up to 10 times compared to existing graph condensation methods while performing on par with state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SimGC in prediction accuracy, condensation time, and generalization capability. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | Under review |

A recent Transformer-based GNN called Graph Transformer is shown to obtain superior performances when long range dependencies exist. However, combining graph data and Transformer architecture led to a combinationally worse memory issue. We propose a novel version of "edge regularization technique" that alleviates the need for Positional Encoding and ultimately alleviate GT's out of memory issue. We observe that it is not clear whether having an edge regularization on top of positional encoding is helpful. However, it seems evident that applying our edge regularization technique indeed stably improves GT's performance compared to GT without Positional Encoding.</p></details> |  |

The efficiency of such collaborations could be influenced by trust relationships among workers. To obtain the asymmetric trust values among all workers in the social network, the Trust Reinforcement Evaluation Framework (TREF) based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) is proposed in this paper. The task completion effect is comprehensively calculated by considering the workers' ability benefits, distance benefits, and trust benefits in this paper. The worker recruitment problem is modeled as an Undirected Complete Recruitment Graph (UCRG), for which a specific Tabu Search Recruitment (TSR) algorithm solution is proposed. An optimal execution team is recruited for each task by the TSR algorithm, and the collaboration team for the task is obtained under the constraint of privacy loss. To enhance the efficiency of the recruitment algorithm on a large scale and scope, the Mini-Batch K-Means clustering algorithm and edge computing technology are introduced, enabling distributed worker recruitment. Lastly, extensive experiments conducted on five real datasets validate that the recruitment algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms other baselines. Additionally, TREF proposed herein surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art trust evaluation methods in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by IEEE TMC, and its DOI is 10.1109/TMC.2024.3373469</p></details> |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

These sparse operations are harder to optimize by manual tuning because their performance depends significantly on the sparsity of input graphs, GNN models, and computing platforms. To address this challenge, we present iSpLib, a PyTorch-based C++ library equipped with auto-tuned sparse operations. iSpLib expedites GNN training with a cache-enabled backpropagation that stores intermediate matrices in local caches. The library offers a user-friendly Python plug-in that allows users to take advantage of our optimized PyTorch operations out-of-the-box for any existing linear algebra-based PyTorch implementation of popular GNNs (Graph Convolution Network, GraphSAGE, Graph Inference Network, etc.) with only two lines of additional code. We demonstrate that iSpLib obtains up to 27x overall training speedup compared to the equivalent PyTorch 2.1.0 and PyTorch Geometric 2.4.0 implementations on the CPU.

| **[Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendation with User-Centric Subgraph Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14377v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems, as widely implemented nowadays on various platforms, recommend relevant items to users based on their preferences. The classical methods which rely on user-item interaction matrices has limitations, especially in scenarios where there is a lack of interaction data for new items. Knowledge graph (KG)-based recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution. However, most KG-based methods adopt node embeddings, which do not provide personalized recommendations for different users and cannot generalize well to the new items. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-enhanced User-Centric subgraph Network (KUCNet), a subgraph learning approach with graph neural network (GNN) for effective recommendation. KUCNet constructs a U-I subgraph for each user-item pair that captures both the historical information of user-item interactions and the side information provided in KG. An attention-based GNN is designed to encode the U-I subgraphs for recommendation. Considering efficiency, the pruned user-centric computation graph is further introduced such that multiple U-I subgraphs can be simultaneously computed and that the size can be pruned by Personalized PageRank. Our proposed method achieves accurate, efficient, and interpretable recommendations especially for new items. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of KUCNet over state-of-the-art KG-based and collaborative filtering (CF)-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Thus, considerable efforts have been made to quickly and accurately estimate the performances of neural architectures, without full training or evaluation, for given tasks and datasets. Neural architecture encoding has played a crucial role in the estimation, and graphbased methods, which treat an architecture as a graph, have shown prominent performance. For enhanced representation learning of neural architectures, we introduce FlowerFormer, a powerful graph transformer that incorporates the information flows within a neural architecture. FlowerFormer consists of two key components: (a) bidirectional asynchronous message passing, inspired by the flows; (b) global attention built on flow-based masking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FlowerFormer over existing neural encoding methods, and its effectiveness extends beyond computer vision models to include graph neural networks and auto speech recognition models.

| **[PGCN: Progressive Graph Convolutional Networks for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08982v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04521v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs. The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution. Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution. Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions. Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization. The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeGraphormer: A High-Performance Graph Transformer with Spiking Graph Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15480v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Graph Transformers have emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the inherent limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and enhance graph representation performance. Unfortunately, Graph Transformers are computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity inherent in self-attention when applied over large-scale graphs, especially for node tasks. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), with event-driven and binary spikes properties, can perform energy-efficient computation. In this work, we propose a novel insight into integrating SNNs with Graph Transformers and design a Spiking Graph Attention (SGA) module. The matrix multiplication is replaced by sparse addition and mask operations. The linear complexity enables all-pair node interactions on large-scale graphs with limited GPU memory. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to introduce SNNs into Graph Transformers. Furthermore, we design SpikeGraphormer, a Dual-branch architecture, combining a sparse GNN branch with our SGA-driven Graph Transformer branch, which can simultaneously perform all-pair node interactions and capture local neighborhoods. SpikeGraphormer consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across various datasets and makes substantial improvements in training time, inference time, and GPU memory cost (10 ~ 20x lower than vanilla self-attention). It also performs well in cross-domain applications (image and text classification). We release our code at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/SpikeGraphormer.</p></details> |  |

This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</p></details> |  |

When considering conceptual counterfactuals on images, the edits requested should correspond to salient concepts present in the input data. At the same time, conceptual distances are defined by knowledge graphs, ensuring the optimality of conceptual edits. In this work, we extend previous endeavors on graph edits as counterfactual explanations by conducting a comparative study which encompasses both supervised and unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. To this end, we pose the following significant research question: should we represent input data as graphs, which is the optimal GNN approach in terms of performance and time efficiency to generate minimal and meaningful counterfactual explanations for black-box image classifiers?</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph-Informed (GI) layers were introduced to address regression tasks on graph nodes, extending their applicability beyond classic GNNs. However, existing implementations of GI layers lack efficiency due to dense memory allocation. This paper presents a sparse implementation of GI layers, leveraging the sparsity of adjacency matrices to reduce memory usage significantly. Additionally, a versatile general form of GI layers is introduced, enabling their application to subsets of graph nodes. The proposed sparse implementation improves the concrete computational efficiency and scalability of the GI layers, permitting to build deeper Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs) and facilitating their scalability to larger graphs.</p></details> |  |

A large class of such systems can be formalized as $\textit{geometric graphs}$, $\textit{i.e.}$, graphs with nodes positioned in the Euclidean space given an $\textit{arbitrarily}$ chosen global coordinate system, for instance vehicles in a traffic scene. Notwithstanding the arbitrary global coordinate system, the governing dynamics of the respective dynamical systems are invariant to rotations and translations, also known as $\textit{Galilean invariance}$. As ignoring these invariances leads to worse generalization, in this work we propose local coordinate frames per node-object to induce roto-translation invariance to the geometric graph of the interacting dynamical system. Further, the local coordinate frames allow for a natural definition of anisotropic filtering in graph neural networks. Experiments in traffic scenes, 3D motion capture, and colliding particles demonstrate that the proposed approach comfortably outperforms the recent state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ne...</summary><p>In NeurIPS 2021.

Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing and Enhancing the Robustness of Large Language Models with Task Structure Variations for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09430v4)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have advanced the performance of AI systems on various natural language processing tasks to human-like levels. However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning.

| **[Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17076v3)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs.

| **[Re2LLM: Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16427v3)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR. However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations. Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones. To address such issues, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently. In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs. To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors. To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent. It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Look Before You Leap: Problem Elaboration Prompting Improves Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15764v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) still grapple with complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. Despite significant efforts invested in improving prefix prompts or reasoning process, the crucial role of problem context might have been neglected. Accurate recognition of inputs is fundamental for solving mathematical tasks, as ill-formed problems could potentially mislead LLM's reasoning. In this study, we propose a new approach named Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to enhance the mathematical capacities of LLMs. Specifically, PEP decomposes and elucidates the problem context before reasoning, therefore enhancing the context modeling and parsing efficiency. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate promising performances: (1) PEP demonstrates an overall enhancement in various mathematical tasks. For instance, with the GPT-3.5 model, PEP exhibits improvements of 9.93% and 8.80% on GSM8k through greedy decoding and self-consistency, respectively. (2) PEP can be easily implemented and integrated with other prompting methods. (3) PEP shows particular strength in handling distraction problems.</p></details> |  |

The ability to explain and control an LLM's reasoning process is key for reliability, transparency, and future model developments. We propose SelfIE (Self-Interpretation of Embeddings), a framework that enables LLMs to interpret their own embeddings in natural language by leveraging their ability to respond to inquiries about a given passage. Capable of interpreting open-world concepts in the hidden embeddings, SelfIE reveals LLM internal reasoning in cases such as making ethical decisions, internalizing prompt injection, and recalling harmful knowledge. SelfIE's text descriptions on hidden embeddings also open up new avenues to control LLM reasoning. We propose Supervised Control, which allows editing open-ended concepts while only requiring gradient computation of individual layer. We extend RLHF to hidden embeddings and propose Reinforcement Control that erases harmful knowledge in LLM without supervision targets.</p></details> |  |

Vulnerability detection is of crucial importance to maintaining the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of software systems. Precise vulnerability detection requires reasoning about the code, making it a good case study for exploring the limits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Although recent work has applied LLMs to vulnerability detection using generic prompting techniques, their full capabilities for this task and the types of errors they make when explaining identified vulnerabilities remain unclear. In this paper, we surveyed eleven LLMs that are state-of-the-art in code generation and commonly used as coding assistants, and evaluated their capabilities for vulnerability detection. We systematically searched for the best-performing prompts, incorporating techniques such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought, and proposed three of our own prompting methods. Our results show that while our prompting methods improved the models' performance, LLMs generally struggled with vulnerability detection. They reported 0.5-0.63 Balanced Accuracy and failed to distinguish between buggy and fixed versions of programs in 76% of cases on average. By comprehensively analyzing and categorizing 287 instances of model reasoning, we found that 57% of LLM responses contained errors, and the models frequently predicted incorrect locations of buggy code and misidentified bug types. LLMs only correctly localized 6 out of 27 bugs in DbgBench, and these 6 bugs were predicted correctly by 70-100% of human participants. These findings suggest that despite their potential for other tasks, LLMs may fail to properly comprehend critical code structures and security-related concepts.

These issues could be partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm ``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Zero-Shot Prompting for Efficient Language Model Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15886v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach for efficiently distilling LLMs into smaller, application-specific models, significantly reducing operational costs and manual labor. Addressing the challenge of deploying computationally intensive LLMs in specific applications or edge devices, this technique utilizes LLMs' reasoning capabilities to generate labels and natural language rationales for unlabeled data. Our approach enhances both finetuning and distillation by employing a multi-task training framework where student models mimic these rationales alongside teacher predictions. Key contributions include the employment of zero-shot prompting to elicit teacher model rationales, reducing the necessity for handcrafted few-shot examples and lowering the overall token count required, which directly translates to cost savings given the pay-per-token billing model of major tech companies' LLM APIs. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of explanation properties on distillation efficiency, demonstrating that minimal performance loss occurs even when rationale augmentation is not applied across the entire dataset, facilitating further reductions of tokens. This research marks a step toward the efficient training of task-specific models with minimal human intervention, offering substantial cost-savings while maintaining, or even enhancing, performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like question-answering, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a minimalist qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. Instead of training data, SphNN uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to guide transformations from the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch by constructing sphere configurations as Euler diagrams, with the worst computational complexity of O(N^2). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing cognitive distortions from the interviewee's utterances can be an essential part of psychotherapy, especially for cognitive behavioral therapy. In this paper, we propose ERD, which improves LLM-based cognitive distortion classification performance with the aid of additional modules of (1) extracting the parts related to cognitive distortion, and (2) debating the reasoning steps by multiple agents. Our experimental results on a public dataset show that ERD improves the multi-class F1 score as well as binary specificity score. Regarding the latter score, it turns out that our method is effective in debiasing the baseline method which has high false positive rate, especially when the summary of multi-agent debate is provided to LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields.

This technique empowers the model to autonomously devise "solution plans" to tackle intricate programming challenges, thereby improving its performance in code generation. Nevertheless, smaller models have been struggling to keep up with LLMs in deducing these plans, adversely affecting their code generation capabilities. Given the considerable size and associated deployment costs, along with concerns about data security, many teams opt for deploying smaller models for code generation. Consequently, there arises a compelling need for transferring LLMs' code generation reasoning abilities to the smaller models. In this paper, we propose the CodePLAN framework, which aims to transfer LLMs' reasoning capabilities to smaller models through distillation. We adopt a multi-task learning approach, jointly undertaking code generation and solution plan generation tasks, to enhance the code generation capabilities of the smaller model. To ensure the superior quality of the solution plans, we advocate for the utilization of backward reasoning and plan sampling strategies. Our experiments show that in comparison to the conventional fine-tuning approach, our approach improves the smaller model's code generation performance (measured in pass@1 metric) by over 130% on the challenging APPS benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Despite this progress, LLMs are still inadequate at social-cognitive reasoning, which humans are naturally good at. Drawing inspiration from psychological research on the links between certain personality traits and Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning, and from prompt engineering research on the hyper-sensitivity of prompts in affecting LLMs capabilities, this study investigates how inducing personalities in LLMs using prompts affects their ToM reasoning capabilities. Our findings show that certain induced personalities can significantly affect the LLMs' reasoning capabilities in three different ToM tasks. In particular, traits from the Dark Triad have a larger variable effect on LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Mistral across the different ToM tasks. We find that LLMs that exhibit a higher variance across personality prompts in ToM also tends to be more controllable in personality tests: personality traits in LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2 and Mistral can be controllably adjusted through our personality prompts. In today's landscape where role-play is a common strategy when using LLMs, our research highlights the need for caution, as models that adopt specific personas with personalities potentially also alter their reasoning abilities in an unexpected manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvGen: Generating and Adapting Environments via LLMs for Training Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12014v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent SOTA approaches for embodied learning via interaction directly employ large language models (LLMs) as agents to determine the next steps in an environment. Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. Instead of directly employing LLMs as agents, can we use LLMs' reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? We propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an LLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn different tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description and simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items given to agents, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agent's performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We show qualitatively how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL agents' weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require thousands of LLM calls. Lastly, we present detailed ablation studies for our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally; Project website: https://envgen-llm.github.io/</p></details> |

The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity, addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better Zero-Shot Reasoning with Role-Play Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07702v2)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for role-playing, enabling them to embody not only human characters but also non-human entities. This versatility allows them to simulate complex human-like interactions and behaviors within various contexts, as well as to emulate specific objects or systems. While these capabilities have enhanced user engagement and introduced novel modes of interaction, the influence of role-playing on LLMs' reasoning abilities remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a strategically designed role-play prompting methodology and assess its performance under the zero-shot setting across twelve diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results illustrate that role-play prompting consistently surpasses the standard zero-shot approach across most datasets. Notably, in experiments conducted using ChatGPT, accuracy on AQuA rises from 53.5% to 63.8%, and on Last Letter from 23.8% to 84.2%.Upon further comparison with the Zero-Shot-CoT technique, which prompts the model to "think step by step", our study demonstrates that role-play prompting acts as a more effective trigger for the CoT process. This highlights its potential to augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We release our code at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Role-Play-Prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024, Main Conference</p></details> |

We compared human and large language model (LLM) performance on a new child-friendly set of ARC items. Results show that both children and adults outperform most LLMs on these tasks. Error analysis revealed a similar "fallback" solution strategy in LLMs and young children, where part of the analogy is simply copied. In addition, we found two other error types, one based on seemingly grasping key concepts (e.g., Inside-Outside) and the other based on simple combinations of analogy input matrices. On the whole, "concept" errors were more common in humans, and "matrix" errors were more common in LLMs. This study sheds new light on LLM reasoning ability and the extent to which we can use error analyses and comparisons with human development to understand how LLMs solve visual analogies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deceptive Semantic Shortcuts on Reasoning Chains: How Far Can Models Go without Hallucination?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09702v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) and their high performances across numerous benchmarks, recent research has unveiled that LLMs suffer from hallucinations and unfaithful reasoning. This work studies a specific type of hallucination induced by semantic associations. Specifically, we investigate to what extent LLMs take shortcuts from certain keyword/entity biases in the prompt instead of following the correct reasoning path. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel probing method and benchmark called EureQA. We start from questions that LLMs will answer correctly with utmost certainty, and mask the important entity with evidence sentence recursively, asking models to find masked entities according to a chain of evidence before answering the question. During the construction of the evidence, we purposefully replace semantic clues (entities) that may lead to the correct answer with distractor clues (evidence) that will not directly lead to the correct answer but require a chain-like reasoning process. We evaluate if models can follow the correct reasoning chain instead of short-cutting through distractor clues. We find that existing LLMs lack the necessary capabilities to follow correct reasoning paths and resist the attempt of greedy shortcuts. We show that the distractor semantic associations often lead to model hallucination, which is strong evidence that questions the validity of current LLM reasoning.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Knowledge-aware Alert Aggregation in Large-scale Cloud Systems: a Hybrid Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06485v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scale and complexity of cloud systems, a system failure would trigger an "alert storm", i.e., massive correlated alerts. Although these alerts can be traced back to a few root causes, the overwhelming number makes it infeasible for manual handling. Alert aggregation is thus critical to help engineers concentrate on the root cause and facilitate failure resolution. Existing methods typically utilize semantic similarity-based methods or statistical methods to aggregate alerts. However, semantic similarity-based methods overlook the causal rationale of alerts, while statistical methods can hardly handle infrequent alerts. To tackle these limitations, we introduce leveraging external knowledge, i.e., Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of alerts as a supplement. We propose COLA, a novel hybrid approach based on correlation mining and LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning for online alert aggregation. The correlation mining module effectively captures the temporal and spatial relations between alerts, measuring their correlations in an efficient manner. Subsequently, only uncertain pairs with low confidence are forwarded to the LLM reasoning module for detailed analysis. This hybrid design harnesses both statistical evidence for frequent alerts and the reasoning capabilities of computationally intensive LLMs, ensuring the overall efficiency of COLA in handling large volumes of alerts in practical scenarios. We evaluate COLA on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform. The experimental results show COLA achieves F1-scores from 0.901 to 0.930, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable efficiency. We also share our experience in deploying COLA in our real-world cloud system, Cloud X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Proceedings of the 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE SEIP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[CoRAL: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Improve Long-tail Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06447v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-tail recommendation is a challenging task for traditional recommender systems, due to data sparsity and data imbalance issues. The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has shown their abilities in complex reasoning, which can help to deduce users' preferences based on very few previous interactions. However, since most LLM-based systems rely on items' semantic meaning as the sole evidence for reasoning, the collaborative information of user-item interactions is neglected, which can cause the LLM's reasoning to be misaligned with task-specific collaborative information of the dataset. To further align LLMs' reasoning to task-specific user-item interaction knowledge, we introduce collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, CoRAL, which directly incorporate collaborative evidence into the prompts. Based on the retrieved user-item interactions, the LLM can analyze shared and distinct preferences among users, and summarize the patterns indicating which types of users would be attracted by certain items. The retrieved collaborative evidence prompts the LLM to align its reasoning with the user-item interaction patterns in the dataset. However, since the capacity of the input prompt is limited, finding the minimally-sufficient collaborative information for recommendation tasks can be challenging. We propose to find the optimal interaction set through a sequential decision-making process and develop a retrieval policy learned through a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, CoRAL. Our experimental results show that CoRAL can significantly improve LLMs' reasoning abilities on specific recommendation tasks. Our analysis also reveals that CoRAL can more efficiently explore collaborative information through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 11 pages |

It has tremendous significance in real-world applications since an average layperson does not excel at differentiating species of birds or mushrooms due to subtle differences among the species. A major bottleneck in developing FGVR systems is caused by the need of high-quality paired expert annotations. To circumvent the need of expert knowledge we propose Fine-grained Semantic Category Reasoning (FineR) that internally leverages the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) as a proxy in order to reason about fine-grained category names. In detail, to bridge the modality gap between images and LLM, we extract part-level visual attributes from images as text and feed that information to a LLM. Based on the visual attributes and its internal world knowledge the LLM reasons about the subordinate-level category names. Our training-free FineR outperforms several state-of-the-art FGVR and language and vision assistant models and shows promise in working in the wild and in new domains where gathering expert annotation is arduous.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2024; Project page: https://projfiner.github.io/</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of RLHF, we study the performance of multiple algorithms that learn from feedback (Expert Iteration, Proximal Policy Optimization (\textbf{PPO}), Return-Conditioned RL) on improving LLM reasoning capabilities. We investigate both sparse and dense rewards provided to the LLM both heuristically and via a learned reward model. We additionally start from multiple model sizes and initializations both with and without supervised fine-tuning (\textbf{SFT}) data. Overall, we find all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases. Surprisingly, we find the sample complexity of Expert Iteration is similar to that of PPO, requiring at most on the order of $10^6$ samples to converge from a pretrained checkpoint. We investigate why this is the case, concluding that during RL training models fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models. Additionally, we discuss a trade off between maj@1 and pass@96 metric performance during SFT training and how conversely RL training improves both simultaneously. We then conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for RLHF and the future role of RL in LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this challenge, we propose Key-Point-Driven Data Synthesis (KPDDS), a novel data synthesis framework that synthesizes question-answer pairs by leveraging key points and exemplar pairs from authentic data sources. KPDDS ensures the generation of novel questions with rigorous quality control and substantial scalability. As a result, we present KPMath, the most extensive synthetic dataset tailored for mathematical reasoning to date, comprising over one million question-answer pairs. Utilizing KPMath and augmenting it with additional reasoning-intensive corpora, we create the comprehensive KPMath-Plus dataset. Fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on KPMath-Plus yields a zero-shot PASS@1 accuracy of 39.3% on the MATH test set, a performance that not only outpaces other finetuned 7B models but also exceeds that of certain 34B models. Our ablation studies further confirm the substantial enhancement in mathematical reasoning across various subtopics, marking a significant stride in LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | In progress |

By correlating CVEs with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, Crimson advances threat anticipation and strategic defense efforts. Our approach includes defining and evaluating cybersecurity strategic tasks, alongside implementing a comprehensive human-in-the-loop data-synthetic workflow to develop the CVE-to-ATT&CK Mapping (CVEM) dataset. We further enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities through a novel Retrieval-Aware Training (RAT) process and its refined iteration, RAT-R. Our findings demonstrate that an LLM fine-tuned with our techniques, possessing 7 billion parameters, approaches the performance level of GPT-4, showing markedly lower rates of hallucination and errors, and surpassing other models in strategic reasoning tasks. Moreover, domain-specific fine-tuning of embedding models significantly improves performance within cybersecurity contexts, underscoring the efficacy of our methodology. By leveraging Crimson to convert raw vulnerability data into structured and actionable insights, we bolster proactive cybersecurity defenses.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Re-Reading Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06275v2)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a simple, yet general and effective prompting method, Re2, i.e., \textbf{Re}-\textbf{Re}ading the question as input. Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2 facilitates a "bidirectional" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating its potential to enable "bidirectional" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate Re2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal Re2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies.

| **[Beyond Natural Language: LLMs Leveraging Alternative Formats for Enhanced Reasoning and Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18439v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/AutoForm}.</p></details> |  |

Interestingly, our results show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve almost the same performance as the best existing discussion approach on a wide range of reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. We observe that the multi-agent discussion performs better than a single agent only when there is no demonstration in the prompt.

By comparing the implied SCM with that of human reasoning, we highlight discrepancies between LLM and human reasoning processes. We further examine the factors influencing the causal structure of the implied SCM, revealing that in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning on human feedback significantly impact the causal relations.

However, the progress in the field of graph reasoning with LLM remains limited. Our work delves into this gap by thoroughly investigating graph reasoning with LLMs. In this work, we reveal the impact of the order of graph description on LLMs' graph reasoning performance, which significantly affects LLMs' reasoning abilities. By altering this order, we enhance the performance of LLMs from 42.22\% to 70\%. Furthermore, we introduce the Scaled Graph Reasoning benchmark for assessing LLMs' performance across various graph sizes and evaluate the relationship between LLMs' graph reasoning abilities and graph size. We discover that the graph reasoning performance of LLMs does not monotonically decrease with the increase in graph size. The experiments span several mainstream models, including GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-2-13B, to offer a comprehensive evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, considering that stance detection usually requires detailed background knowledge, the vanilla reasoning method may neglect the domain knowledge to make a professional and accurate analysis. Thus, there is still room for improvement of LLMs reasoning, especially in leveraging the generation capability of LLMs to simulate specific experts (i.e., multi-agents) to detect the stance. In this paper, different from existing multi-agent works that require detailed descriptions and use fixed experts, we propose a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) method which can leverage the generated experienced experts and let LLMs reason in a semi-parametric way, making the experts more generalizable and reliable. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEM consistently achieves the best results on three standard benchmarks, outperforms methods with self-consistency reasoning, and reduces the bias of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multiagent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning -- both individually and as a team -- surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH.

In contrast to previous approaches that relied on smaller amateur models or analysis of hidden state differences, DCD employs Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting and advanced distillation techniques, including Dropout and Quantization. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of Contrastive Decoding (CD), which typically requires both an expert and an amateur model, thus increasing computational resource demands. By integrating contrastive prompts with distillation, DCD obviates the need for an amateur model and reduces memory usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that DCD significantly enhances LLM performance across a range of reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both CD and existing methods in the GSM8K and StrategyQA datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, generating the correct solution in a single attempt still remains a challenge. Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph. MPSC significantly boosts performance of foundation models (ChatGPT in this paper) on various benchmarks, including HumanEval (+15.91%), MBPP (+6.43%) and CodeContests (+9.37%), even surpassing GPT-4.</p></details> | Preprint version |

This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help.

This process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, can enhance self-consistency, interpretability, and tasks such as medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on a total of four commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We find that the strategy of PoE always underperforms the strategy of choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct error analyses and give suggestions for future work.</p></details> | In progress preprint |

Despite LLMs advancements in recent times, their performance consistency across different input lengths is not well understood. We investigate this aspect by introducing a novel QA reasoning framework, specifically designed to assess the impact of input length. We isolate the effect of input length using multiple versions of the same sample, each being extended with padding of different lengths, types and locations. Our findings show a notable degradation in LLMs' reasoning performance at much shorter input lengths than their technical maximum. We show that the degradation trend appears in every version of our dataset, although at different intensities. Additionally, our study reveals that traditional perplexity metrics do not correlate with performance of LLMs' in long input reasoning tasks. We analyse our results and identify failure modes that can serve as useful guides for future research, potentially informing strategies to address the limitations observed in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Researchers often co-train KG embeddings and LLM parameters to equip LLMs with the ability of comprehending KG knowledge. However, this resource-hungry training paradigm significantly increases the model learning cost and is also unsuitable for non-open-source, black-box LLMs. In this paper, we employ complex question answering (CQA) as a task to assess the LLM's ability of comprehending KG knowledge. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of KG knowledge injection methods (from triples to natural language text), aiming to explore the optimal prompting method for supplying KG knowledge to LLMs, thereby enhancing their comprehension of KG. Contrary to our initial expectations, our analysis revealed that LLMs effectively handle messy, noisy, and linearized KG knowledge, outperforming methods that employ well-designed natural language (NL) textual prompts. This counter-intuitive finding provides substantial insights for future research on LLMs' comprehension of structured knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, hand-crafted meta-structures pose challenges for scaling up, which draws wide research attention for developing automatic meta-structure search algorithms. Previous efforts concentrate on searching for meta-structures with good empirical prediction performance, overlooking explainability. Thus, they often produce meta-structures prone to overfitting and incomprehensible to humans. To address this, we draw inspiration from the emergent reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose a novel REasoning meta-STRUCTure search (ReStruct) framework that integrates LLM reasoning into the evolutionary procedure. ReStruct uses a grammar translator to encode meta-structures into natural language sentences, and leverages the reasoning power of LLMs to evaluate semantically feasible meta-structures. ReStruct also employs performance-oriented evolutionary operations. These two competing forces jointly optimize for semantic explainability and empirical performance of meta-structures. We also design a differential LLM explainer that can produce natural language explanations for the discovered meta-structures, and refine the explanation by reasoning through the search history. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate ReStruct achieve SOTA performance in node classification and link recommendation tasks. Additionally, a survey study involving 73 graduate students shows that the meta-structures and natural language explanations generated by ReStruct are substantially more comprehensible.</p></details> |  |

Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex and abstract conclusions and premises, and improve various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rule and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities~\footnote{Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/ULogic}.}.</p></details> |  |

However, previous table reasoning solutions only consider small-sized tables and exhibit limitations in handling larger tables. In addition, most existing methods struggle to reason over complex questions since they lack essential information or they are scattered in different places. To alleviate these challenges, we propose TAP4LLM as a versatile pre-processing toolbox to generate table prompts through (1) table sampling, (2) table augmentation, and (3) table packing while balancing the token allocation trade-off. In each module, we collect and design several common methods for usage in various scenarios (e.g., speed over accuracy). We also provide a comprehensive evaluation on performance of each components inside TAP4LLM and show that our method improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities in various tabular tasks and enhances the interaction between LLMs and tabular data by employing effective pre-processing.</p></details> |  |

However, Existing large language models'(LLMs) reasoning ability in multi-hop question answering remains exploration, which is inadequate in answering multi-hop questions. Moreover, it is unclear whether LLMs follow a desired reasoning chain to reach the right final answer. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{gen}erative question \textbf{dec}omposition method (GenDec) from the perspective of explainable QA by generating independent and complete sub-questions based on incorporating additional extracted evidence for enhancing LLMs' reasoning ability in RAG. To demonstrate the impact, generalization, and robustness of Gendec, we conduct two experiments, the first is combining GenDec with small QA systems on paragraph retrieval and QA tasks. We secondly examine the reasoning capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 combined with GenDec. We experiment on the HotpotQA, 2WikihopMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and PokeMQA datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting mobility data can be prohibitively expensive and involves serious privacy issues, posing a pressing need for high-quality generative mobility models. Previous efforts focus on learning the behaviour distribution from training samples, and generate new mobility data by sampling the learned distributions. They cannot effectively capture the coherent intentions that drive mobility behavior, leading to low sample efficiency and semantic-awareness. Inspired by the emergent reasoning ability in LLMs, we propose a radical perspective shift that reformulates mobility generation as a commonsense reasoning problem. In this paper, we design a novel Mobility Generation as Reasoning (MobiGeaR) framework that prompts LLM to recursively generate mobility behaviour. Specifically, we design a context-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting technique to align LLMs with context-aware mobility behaviour by few-shot in-context learning. Besides, MobiGeaR employ a divide-and-coordinate mechanism to exploit the synergistic effect between LLM reasoning and mechanistic gravity model. It leverages the step-by-step LLM reasoning to recursively generate a temporal template of activity intentions, which are then mapped to physical locations with a mechanistic gravity model. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MobiGeaR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and substantially reduces the size of training samples at the same time. Besides, MobiGeaR also significantly improves the semantic-awareness of mobility generation by improving the intention accuracy by 62.23% and the generated mobility data is proven effective in boosting the performance of downstream applications. The implementation of our approach is available in the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fewer is More: Boosting LLM Reasoning with Reinforced Context Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08901v3)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet they still struggle with math reasoning. In this work, we propose CoT-Influx, a novel approach that pushes the boundary of few-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) learning to improve LLM mathematical reasoning. Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. A math reasoning dataset with diverse difficulty levels and reasoning steps is used to train the pruner, along with a math-specialized reinforcement learning approach. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Influx surpasses GPT-3.5 and a wide range of larger LLMs (PaLM, Minerva 540B, etc.) on the GSM8K. CoT-Influx serves as a plug-and-play module for LLMs and is compatible with most existing reasoning prompting techniques, such as self-consistency and self-verification.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include an innovative document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLoRe: When, Where, and How to Improve LLM Reasoning via Global and Local Refinements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10963v1)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art language models can exhibit impressive reasoning refinement capabilities on math, science or coding tasks. However, recent work demonstrates that even the best models struggle to identify \textit{when and where to refine} without access to external feedback. Outcome-based Reward Models (\textbf{ORMs}), trained to predict correctness of the final answer indicating when to refine, offer one convenient solution for deciding when to refine. Process Based Reward Models (\textbf{PRMs}), trained to predict correctness of intermediate steps, can then be used to indicate where to refine. But they are expensive to train, requiring extensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose Stepwise ORMs (\textbf{SORMs}) which are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of the optimal policy or $V^{\star}$. More specifically, SORMs are trained to predict the correctness of the final answer when sampling the current policy many times (rather than only once as in the case of ORMs). Our experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps compared to ORMs, thus improving downstream accuracy when doing refinements. We then train \textit{global} refinement models, which take only the question and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and \textit{local} refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements, using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually, as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53\% to 65\% when greedily sampled.</p></details> |  |

We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, KDD Preprint</p></details> |
| **[An Enhanced Prompt-Based LLM Reasoning Scheme via Knowledge Graph-Integrated Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04978v1)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in a multitude of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they encounter challenges in practical applications, including issues with hallucinations, inadequate knowledge updating, and limited transparency in the reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687v4)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.</p></details> |  |

Updating these models with new knowledge is very expensive, and is often required to fully realize their value. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective model editing approach, \textsc{MENT}, to patch LLMs in coding tasks. Based on the mechanism of generative LLMs, \textsc{MENT} enables model editing in next-token predictions, and further supports common coding tasks. \textsc{MENT} is effective, efficient, and reliable. It can correct a neural model by patching 1 or 2 neurons. As the pioneer work on neuron-level model editing of generative models, we formalize the editing process and introduce the involved concepts. Besides, we also introduce new measures to evaluate its generalization ability, and build a benchmark for further study. Our approach is evaluated on three coding tasks, including API-seq recommendation, line-level code generation, and pseudocode-to-code transaction. It outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin on both effectiveness and efficiency measures. In addition, we demonstrate the usages of \textsc{MENT} for LLM reasoning in software engineering. By editing the LLM knowledge with \textsc{MENT}, the directly or indirectly dependent behaviors in the chain-of-thought change accordingly and automatically.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, under peer review</p></details> |

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of LLMs in executing real-time strategy war tasks within the StarCraft II gaming environment. In this paper, we introduce SwarmBrain, an embodied agent leveraging LLM for real-time strategy implementation in the StarCraft II game environment. The SwarmBrain comprises two key components: 1) a Overmind Intelligence Matrix, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, is designed to orchestrate macro-level strategies from a high-level perspective. This matrix emulates the overarching consciousness of the Zerg intelligence brain, synthesizing strategic foresight with the aim of allocating resources, directing expansion, and coordinating multi-pronged assaults. 2) a Swarm ReflexNet, which is agile counterpart to the calculated deliberation of the Overmind Intelligence Matrix. Due to the inherent latency in LLM reasoning, the Swarm ReflexNet employs a condition-response state machine framework, enabling expedited tactical responses for fundamental Zerg unit maneuvers. In the experimental setup, SwarmBrain is in control of the Zerg race in confrontation with an Computer-controlled Terran adversary. Experimental results show the capacity of SwarmBrain to conduct economic augmentation, territorial expansion, and tactical formulation, and it shows the SwarmBrain is capable of achieving victory against Computer players set at different difficulty levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recommender Systems with Large Language Model Reasoning Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10835v2)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems aim to provide users with relevant suggestions, but often lack interpretability and fail to capture higher-level semantic relationships between user behaviors and profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct personalized reasoning graphs. These graphs link a user's profile and behavioral sequences through causal and logical inferences, representing the user's interests in an interpretable way. Our approach, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG), has four components: chained graph reasoning, divergent extension, self-verification and scoring, and knowledge base self-improvement. The resulting reasoning graph is encoded using graph neural networks, which serves as additional input to improve conventional recommender systems, without requiring extra user or item information. Our approach demonstrates how LLMs can enable more logical and interpretable recommender systems through personalized reasoning graphs. LLMRG allows recommendations to benefit from both engineered recommendation systems and LLM-derived reasoning graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMRG on benchmarks and real-world scenarios in enhancing base recommendation models.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04925v3)** | 2024-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SocraSynth, a multi-LLM agent reasoning platform developed to mitigate these issues. SocraSynth utilizes conditional statistics and systematic context enhancement through continuous arguments, alongside adjustable debate contentiousness levels. The platform typically involves a human moderator and two LLM agents representing opposing viewpoints on a given subject. SocraSynth operates in two main phases: knowledge generation and reasoning evaluation. In the knowledge generation phase, the moderator defines the debate topic and contentiousness level, prompting the agents to formulate supporting arguments for their respective stances. The reasoning evaluation phase then employs Socratic reasoning and formal logic principles to appraise the quality of the arguments presented. The dialogue concludes with the moderator adjusting the contentiousness from confrontational to collaborative, gathering final, conciliatory remarks to aid in human reasoning and decision-making. Through case studies in three distinct application domains, this paper showcases SocraSynth's effectiveness in fostering rigorous research, dynamic reasoning, comprehensive assessment, and enhanced collaboration. This underscores the value of multi-agent interactions in leveraging LLMs for advanced knowledge extraction and decision-making support.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 fig...</summary><p>1 figure, 6 tables, 6 appendices</p></details> |

Especially in scenarios that require long logical chains or complex reasoning, the hallucination and knowledge limitation of LLM limit its performance in question answering (QA). In this paper, we propose a novel framework KnowledgeNavigator to address these challenges by efficiently and accurately retrieving external knowledge from knowledge graph and using it as a key factor to enhance LLM reasoning. Specifically, KnowledgeNavigator first mines and enhances the potential constraints of the given question to guide the reasoning. Then it retrieves and filters external knowledge that supports answering through iterative reasoning on knowledge graph with the guidance of LLM and the question. Finally, KnowledgeNavigator constructs the structured knowledge into effective prompts that are friendly to LLM to help its reasoning. We evaluate KnowledgeNavigator on multiple public KGQA benchmarks, the experiments show the framework has great effectiveness and generalization, outperforming previous knowledge graph enhanced LLM methods and is comparable to the fully supervised models.</p></details> |  |

Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The First International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (ICSE 2024)</p></details> |

Turbulence consists of a large set of natural language $\textit{question templates}$, each of which is a programming problem, parameterised so that it can be asked in many different forms. Each question template has an associated $\textit{test oracle}$ that judges whether a code solution returned by an LLM is correct. Thus, from a single question template, it is possible to ask an LLM a $\textit{neighbourhood}$ of very similar programming questions, and assess the correctness of the result returned for each question. This allows gaps in an LLM's code generation abilities to be identified, including $\textit{anomalies}$ where the LLM correctly solves $\textit{almost all}$ questions in a neighbourhood but fails for particular parameter instantiations. We present experiments against five LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere and Meta, each at two temperature configurations. Our findings show that, across the board, Turbulence is able to reveal gaps in LLM reasoning ability. This goes beyond merely highlighting that LLMs sometimes produce wrong code (which is no surprise): by systematically identifying cases where LLMs are able to solve some problems in a neighbourhood but do not manage to generalise to solve the whole neighbourhood, our method is effective at highlighting $\textit{robustness}$ issues. We present data and examples that shed light on the kinds of mistakes that LLMs make when they return incorrect code results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified a typo in the conclusion section regarding the impact of temperature reduction on the diversity of errors</p></details> |
| **[Divide and Conquer for Large Language Models Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05190v1)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various reasoning benchmarks with the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its derivative methods, particularly in tasks involving multi-choice questions (MCQs). However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning. First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ($\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants. Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities across nine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks. For instance, compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsets of 8.72\% for AQuA, 15.07\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\% for RiddleSense. In addition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number of options, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models from referring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevant choices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.

A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason." However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes. Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope. In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic. The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well. We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%. In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4. As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively. All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM leaderboards often reference scores reported in other papers without consistent settings and prompts, which may inadvertently encourage cherry-picking favored settings and prompts for better results. In this work, we introduce GPT-Fathom, an open-source and reproducible LLM evaluation suite built on top of OpenAI Evals. We systematically evaluate 10+ leading LLMs as well as OpenAI's legacy models on 20+ curated benchmarks across 7 capability categories, all under aligned settings. Our retrospective study on OpenAI's earlier models offers valuable insights into the evolutionary path from GPT-3 to GPT-4. Currently, the community is eager to know how GPT-3 progressively improves to GPT-4, including technical details like whether adding code data improves LLM's reasoning capability, which aspects of LLM capability can be improved by SFT and RLHF, how much is the alignment tax, etc. Our analysis sheds light on many of these questions, aiming to improve the transparency of advanced LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Play StarCraft II: Benchmarks and A Chain of Summarization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>StarCraft II is a challenging benchmark for AI agents due to the necessity of both precise micro level operations and strategic macro awareness. Previous works, such as Alphastar and SCC, achieve impressive performance on tackling StarCraft II , however, still exhibit deficiencies in long term strategic planning and strategy interpretability. Emerging large language model (LLM) agents, such as Voyage and MetaGPT, presents the immense potential in solving intricate tasks. Motivated by this, we aim to validate the capabilities of LLMs on StarCraft II, a highly complex RTS game.To conveniently take full advantage of LLMs` reasoning abilities, we first develop textual StratCraft II environment, called TextStarCraft II, which LLM agent can interact. Secondly, we propose a Chain of Summarization method, including single frame summarization for processing raw observations and multi frame summarization for analyzing game information, providing command recommendations, and generating strategic decisions. Our experiment consists of two parts: first, an evaluation by human experts, which includes assessing the LLMs`s mastery of StarCraft II knowledge and the performance of LLM agents in the game; second, the in game performance of LLM agents, encompassing aspects like win rate and the impact of Chain of Summarization.Experiment results demonstrate that: 1. LLMs possess the relevant knowledge and complex planning abilities needed to address StarCraft II scenarios; 2. Human experts consider the performance of LLM agents to be close to that of an average player who has played StarCraft II for eight years; 3. LLM agents are capable of defeating the built in AI at the Harder(Lv5) difficulty level. We have open sourced the code and released demo videos of LLM agent playing StarCraft II.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexities of sequential recommendation, such as sequential patterns across datasets, noise within sequences, and the temporal evolution of user preferences, existing LLM reasoning strategies, such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought are not fully effective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reasoning principle: Dynamic Reflection with Divergent Thinking within a retriever-reranker framework. Our approach starts with a collaborative in-context demonstration retriever, which collects sequences exhibiting collaborative behaviors as in-context examples. Following this, we abstract high-level user preferences across multiple aspects, providing a more nuanced understanding of user interests and circumventing the noise within the raw sequences. The cornerstone of our methodology is dynamic reflection, a process that emulates human learning through probing, critiquing, and reflecting, using user feedback to tailor the analysis more effectively to the target user in a temporal manner. We evaluate our approach on three datasets using six pre-trained LLMs. The superior performance observed across these models demonstrates the efficacy of our reasoning strategy, notably achieved without the need to fine-tune the LLMs. With our principle, we managed to outperform GPT-Turbo-3.5 on three datasets using 7b models e.g., Vicuna-7b and Openchat-7b on NDCG@10. This research not only highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing sequential recommendation systems but also underscores the importance of developing tailored reasoning strategies to fully harness their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models to Facilitate Legal Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13095v1)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language serves as a vehicle for conveying thought, enabling communication among individuals. The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts, identify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions fundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in logical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation methodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute to the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks while acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic.</p></details> | ALP@JURIX2023 |
| **[Think Twice: Perspective-Taking Improves Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10227v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human interactions are deeply rooted in the interplay of thoughts, beliefs, and desires made possible by Theory of Mind (ToM): our cognitive ability to understand the mental states of ourselves and others. Although ToM may come naturally to us, emulating it presents a challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent improvements to LLMs' reasoning capabilities from simple yet effective prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought have seen limited applicability to ToM. In this paper, we turn to the prominent cognitive science theory "Simulation Theory" to bridge this gap. We introduce SimToM, a novel two-stage prompting framework inspired by Simulation Theory's notion of perspective-taking. To implement this idea on current ToM benchmarks, SimToM first filters context based on what the character in question knows before answering a question about their mental state. Our approach, which requires no additional training and minimal prompt-tuning, shows substantial improvement over existing methods, and our analysis reveals the importance of perspective-taking to Theory-of-Mind capabilities. Our findings suggest perspective-taking as a promising direction for future research into improving LLMs' ToM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models can Solve Computer Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17491v3)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents capable of carrying out general tasks on a computer can improve efficiency and productivity by automating repetitive tasks and assisting in complex problem-solving. Ideally, such agents should be able to solve new computer tasks presented to them through natural language commands. However, previous approaches to this problem require large amounts of expert demonstrations and task-specific reward functions, both of which are impractical for new tasks. In this work, we show that a pre-trained large language model (LLM) agent can execute computer tasks guided by natural language using a simple prompting scheme where the agent Recursively Criticizes and Improves its output (RCI). The RCI approach significantly outperforms existing LLM methods for automating computer tasks and surpasses supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on the MiniWoB++ benchmark. We compare multiple LLMs and find that RCI with the InstructGPT-3+RLHF LLM is state-of-the-art on MiniWoB++, using only a handful of demonstrations per task rather than tens of thousands, and without a task-specific reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate RCI prompting's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities on a suite of natural language reasoning tasks, outperforming chain of thought (CoT) prompting with external feedback. We find that RCI combined with CoT performs better than either separately. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/posgnu/rci-agent.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable performance, understanding their decision-making process remains a big challenge. In this paper, we look into bringing some transparency to this process by introducing a new explanation dataset for question answering (QA) tasks that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) in a novel way. Our dataset includes 12,102 question-answer-explanation (QAE) triples. Each explanation in the dataset links the LLM's reasoning to entities and relations in the KGs. The explanation component includes a why-choose explanation, a why-not-choose explanation, and a set of reason-elements that underlie the LLM's decision. We leverage KGs and graph attention networks (GAT) to find the reason-elements and transform them into why-choose and why-not-choose explanations that are comprehensible to humans. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the potential of our dataset to improve the in-context learning of LLMs, and enhance their interpretability and explainability. Our work contributes to the field of explainable AI by enabling a deeper understanding of the LLMs decision-making process to make them more transparent and thereby, potentially more reliable, to researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[QualEval: Qualitative Evaluation for Model Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02807v1)** | 2023-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative evaluation metrics have traditionally been pivotal in gauging the advancements of artificial intelligence systems, including large language models (LLMs). However, these metrics have inherent limitations. Given the intricate nature of real-world tasks, a single scalar to quantify and compare is insufficient to capture the fine-grained nuances of model behavior. Metrics serve only as a way to compare and benchmark models, and do not yield actionable diagnostics, thus making the model improvement process challenging. Model developers find themselves amid extensive manual efforts involving sifting through vast datasets and attempting hit-or-miss adjustments to training data or setups. In this work, we address the shortcomings of quantitative metrics by proposing QualEval, which augments quantitative scalar metrics with automated qualitative evaluation as a vehicle for model improvement. QualEval uses a powerful LLM reasoner and our novel flexible linear programming solver to generate human-readable insights that when applied, accelerate model improvement. The insights are backed by a comprehensive dashboard with fine-grained visualizations and human-interpretable analyses. We corroborate the faithfulness of QualEval by demonstrating that leveraging its insights, for example, improves the absolute performance of the Llama 2 model by up to 15% points relative on a challenging dialogue task (DialogSum) when compared to baselines. QualEval successfully increases the pace of model development, thus in essence serving as a data-scientist-in-a-box. Given the focus on critiquing and improving current evaluation metrics, our method serves as a refreshingly new technique for both model evaluation and improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hint-enhanced In-Context Learning wakes Large Language Models up for knowledge-intensive tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01949v1)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) ability has emerged with the increasing scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to learn input-label mappings from demonstrations and perform well on downstream tasks. However, under the standard ICL setting, LLMs may sometimes neglect query-related information in demonstrations, leading to incorrect predictions. To address this limitation, we propose a new paradigm called Hint-enhanced In-Context Learning (HICL) to explore the power of ICL in open-domain question answering, an important form in knowledge-intensive tasks. HICL leverages LLMs' reasoning ability to extract query-related knowledge from demonstrations, then concatenates the knowledge to prompt LLMs in a more explicit way. Furthermore, we track the source of this knowledge to identify specific examples, and introduce a Hint-related Example Retriever (HER) to select informative examples for enhanced demonstrations. We evaluate HICL with HER on 3 open-domain QA benchmarks, and observe average performance gains of 2.89 EM score and 2.52 F1 score on gpt-3.5-turbo, 7.62 EM score and 7.27 F1 score on LLaMA-2-Chat-7B compared with standard setting.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance on text-to-SQL parsing still has much room for improvement. In this paper, we hypothesize that a crucial aspect of LLMs to improve for text-to-SQL parsing is their multi-step reasoning ability. Thus, we systematically study how to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability through chain of thought (CoT) style prompting, including the original chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2023). Our experiments demonstrate that iterative prompting as in Zhou et al. (2023) may be unnecessary for text-to-SQL parsing, and using detailed reasoning steps tends to have more error propagation issues. Based on these findings, we propose a new CoT-style prompting method for text-to-SQL parsing. It brings 5.2 and 6.5 point absolute gains on the Spider development set and the Spider Realistic set, respectively, compared to the standard prompting method without reasoning steps; 2.4 and 1.5 point absolute gains, compared to the least-to-most prompting method.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023 main; long paper</p></details> |

We study the problem of prompt designing in the text-to-SQL task and attempt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability when generating SQL queries. Besides the trivial few-shot in-context learning setting, we design our chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt with a similar method to schema linking. We provide a method named ACT-SQL to automatically generate auto-CoT exemplars and thus the whole process doesn't need manual labeling. Our approach is cost-saving since we only use the LLMs' API call once when generating one SQL query. Furthermore, we extend our in-context learning method to the multi-turn text-to-SQL task. The experiment results show that the LLMs' performance can benefit from our ACT-SQL approach. Our approach achieves SOTA performance on the Spider dev set among existing in-context learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the growth of the reasoning chain introduces uncertainty and error accumulation, making it challenging to elicit accurate final results. To tackle this challenge of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning, we introduce a stepwise self-evaluation mechanism to guide and calibrate the reasoning process of LLMs. We propose a decoding algorithm integrating the self-evaluation guidance via stochastic beam search. The self-evaluation guidance serves as a better-calibrated automatic criterion, facilitating an efficient search in the reasoning space and resulting in superior prediction quality. Stochastic beam search balances exploitation and exploration of the search space with temperature-controlled randomness. Our approach surpasses the corresponding Codex-backboned baselines in few-shot accuracy by $6.34\%$, $9.56\%$, and $5.46\%$ on the GSM8K, AQuA, and StrategyQA benchmarks, respectively. Experiment results with Llama-2 on arithmetic reasoning demonstrate the efficiency of our method in outperforming the baseline methods with comparable computational budgets. Further analysis in multi-step reasoning finds our self-evaluation guidance pinpoints logic failures and leads to higher consistency and robustness.

| **[Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992v2)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, CoT). However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal $\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework, $\underline{R}$easoning vi$\underline{a}$ $\underline{P}$lanning $\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration $\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. RAP on LLAMA-33B surpasses CoT on GPT-4 with 33% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023.

Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13160v2)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments. Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests more careful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs can improve their responses based on feedback.</p></details> | EMNLP-23 (findings) |

However, LLMs face challenges in maintaining factual consistency during reasoning, exhibiting tendencies to condition overlooking, question misinterpretation, and condition hallucination over given problems. Existing methods use coarse-grained feedback (e.g., whether the answer is correct) to improve factual consistency. In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing Chain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities by automatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs, generated solutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct the problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between the original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual inconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT formulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide LLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of RCoT over standard CoT, Self-Consistency and Self-Refine across seven arithmetic datasets. Moreover, we find that manually written fine-grained feedback can dramatically improve LLMs' reasoning abilities (e.g., ChatGPT reaches 94.6% accuracy on GSM8K), encouraging the community to further explore the fine-grained feedback generation methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 21 figures |

Inspired by the great success of code data in training LLMs, we naturally wonder at which training stage introducing code data can really help LLMs reasoning. To this end, this paper systematically explores the impact of code data on LLMs at different stages. Concretely, we introduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both of them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively and fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks in five domains. We critically analyze the experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training LLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the instruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capability. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to learn reasoning capability step-by-step during training. These insights deepen the understanding of LLMs regarding reasoning ability for their application, such as scientific question answering, legal support, etc. The source code and model parameters are released at the link:~\url{https://github.com/yingweima2022/CodeLLM}.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs' reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.</p></details> |  |

This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works, additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large margin.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the effect of code on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability by introducing different constraints on the \textit{Code Usage Frequency} of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. We found that its success can be largely attributed to its powerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code execution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs.

This method employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to use code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state registers as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution, analogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics examination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification result indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the effectiveness of majority voting.

For example, users don't always get desirable answers for complex mathematical problems without human involvement. Against this background, we present the Manual Correction System (MCS) -- a human-in-the-loop system enhanced by Chain-of-Thought prompting, which explores how manual correction of sub-logics in rationales can improve LLM's reasoning performance. Moving one step forward, considering a system with human-in-the-loop involves more than having humans improve performance but also controlling the cost. Therefore, we post a Cost-utility Analysis Model for Human-in-the-Loop systems (CAMLOP) based on classical economics theory to analyze, quantify and balance the utility and the corresponding cost. We conduct experiments of MCS and CAMLOP with twelve datasets. A significant advantage w.r.t cost and utility proves its superiority over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Qualitative Research Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13298v1)** | 2023-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of AI driven large language models (LLMs) have stirred discussions about their role in qualitative research. Some view these as tools to enrich human understanding, while others perceive them as threats to the core values of the discipline. This study aimed to compare and contrast the comprehension capabilities of humans and LLMs. We conducted an experiment with small sample of Alexa app reviews, initially classified by a human analyst. LLMs were then asked to classify these reviews and provide the reasoning behind each classification. We compared the results with human classification and reasoning. The research indicated a significant alignment between human and ChatGPT 3.5 classifications in one third of cases, and a slightly lower alignment with GPT4 in over a quarter of cases. The two AI models showed a higher alignment, observed in more than half of the instances. However, a consensus across all three methods was seen only in about one fifth of the classifications. In the comparison of human and LLMs reasoning, it appears that human analysts lean heavily on their individual experiences. As expected, LLMs, on the other hand, base their reasoning on the specific word choices found in app reviews and the functional components of the app itself. Our results highlight the potential for effective human LLM collaboration, suggesting a synergistic rather than competitive relationship. Researchers must continuously evaluate LLMs role in their work, thereby fostering a future where AI and humans jointly enrich qualitative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TART: A plug-and-play Transformer module for task-agnostic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07536v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit in-context learning abilities which enable the same model to perform several tasks without any task-specific training. In contrast, traditional adaptation approaches, such as fine-tuning, modify the underlying models for each specific task. In-context learning, however, consistently underperforms task-specific tuning approaches even when presented with the same examples. While most existing approaches (e.g., prompt engineering) focus on the LLM's learned representations to patch this performance gap, our analysis actually reveal that LLM representations contain sufficient information to make good predictions. As such, we focus on the LLM's reasoning abilities and demonstrate that this performance gap exists due to their inability to perform simple probabilistic reasoning tasks. This raises an intriguing question: Are LLMs actually capable of learning how to reason in a task-agnostic manner? We answer this in the affirmative and propose TART which generically improves an LLM's reasoning abilities using a synthetically trained Transformer-based reasoning module. TART trains this reasoning module in a task-agnostic manner using only synthetic logistic regression tasks and composes it with an arbitrary real-world pre-trained model without any additional training. With a single inference module, TART improves performance across different model families (GPT-Neo, Pythia, BLOOM), model sizes (100M - 6B), tasks (14 NLP binary classification tasks), and even across different modalities (audio and vision). Additionally, on the RAFT Benchmark, TART improves GPT-Neo (125M)'s performance such that it outperforms BLOOM (176B), and is within 4% of GPT-3 (175B). Our code and models are available at https://github.com/HazyResearch/TART .</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive efforts in developing general-purpose LLMs that can be utilized in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been less research exploring their potential in recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PALR, which aiming to combine user history behaviors (such as clicks, purchases, ratings, etc.) with LLMs to generate user preferred items. Specifically, we first use user/item interactions as guidance for candidate retrieval. Then we adopt a LLM-based ranking model to generate recommended items. Unlike existing approaches that typically adopt general-purpose LLMs for zero/few-shot recommendation testing or training on small-sized language models (with less than 1 billion parameters), which cannot fully elicit LLMs' reasoning abilities and leverage rich item side parametric knowledge, we fine-tune a 7 billion parameters LLM for the ranking purpose. This model takes retrieval candidates in natural language format as input, with instruction which explicitly asking to select results from input candidates during inference. Our experimental results demonstrate that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art models on various sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@1 performance on HumanEval from 67\% to 85\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans. Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers. We release our code at https://github.com/ezelikman/parsel</p></details> | <details><summary>human...</summary><p>humaneval results, clarity</p></details> |

Existing ALM systems trigger LLM thought processes while pulling observations from these tools in an interleaved fashion. Specifically, an LLM reasons to call an external tool, gets halted to fetch the tool's response, and then decides the next action based on all preceding response tokens. Such a paradigm, though straightforward and easy to implement, often leads to huge computation complexity from redundant prompts and repeated execution. This study addresses such challenges for the first time, proposing a modular paradigm ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation) that detaches the reasoning process from external observations, thus significantly reducing token consumption. Comprehensive evaluations across six public NLP benchmarks and a curated dataset reveal consistent performance enhancements with our proposed methodology. Notably, ReWOO achieves 5x token efficiency and 4% accuracy improvement on HotpotQA, a multi-step reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, ReWOO demonstrates robustness under tool-failure scenarios. Beyond prompt efficiency, decoupling parametric modules from non-parametric tool calls enables instruction fine-tuning to offload LLMs into smaller language models, thus substantially reducing model parameters. Our illustrative work offloads reasoning ability from 175B GPT3.5 into 7B LLaMA, demonstrating the significant potential for truly efficient and scalable ALM systems.</p></details> |  |

Text-to-SQL is a critical semantic parsing task that converts natural language questions into SQL statements, involving a complex reasoning process. However, there is little work about using CoT prompting to activate LLM's reasoning capabilities on Text-to-SQL tasks. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for prompting Text-to-SQL tasks, called Divide-and-Prompt, which first divides the task into subtasks, and then approach each subtask through CoT. We present 3 prompting-based methods to enhance the Text-to-SQL ability of LLMs. Experiments show that these prompts guide LLMs to generate Text-to-SQL with higher execution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Feature Unlearning for Pre-trained GANs and VAEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05699v4)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of feature unlearning from a pre-trained image generative model: GANs and VAEs. Unlike a common unlearning task where an unlearning target is a subset of the training set, we aim to unlearn a specific feature, such as hairstyle from facial images, from the pre-trained generative models. As the target feature is only presented in a local region of an image, unlearning the entire image from the pre-trained model may result in losing other details in the remaining region of the image. To specify which features to unlearn, we collect randomly generated images that contain the target features. We then identify a latent representation corresponding to the target feature and then use the representation to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Through experiments on MNIST, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets, we show that target features are successfully removed while keeping the fidelity of the original models. Further experiments with an adversarial attack show that the unlearned model is more robust under the presence of malicious parties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13682v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention recently for its potential to achieve Safe AI by removing the influence of specific data from trained machine learning models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses AI governance concerns of training data such as quality, sensitivity, copyright restrictions, and obsolescence. This capability is also crucial for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as the Right To Be Forgotten. Furthermore, effective knowledge removal mitigates the risk of harmful outcomes, safeguarding against biases, misinformation, and unauthorized data exploitation, thereby enhancing the safe and responsible use of AI systems. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service, allowing users to submit requests to remove specific data from the training corpus. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems, such as information leakage and malicious unlearning requests, that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. For instance, unlearning can act as a mechanism to recover models from backdoor attacks, while backdoor attacks themselves can serve as an evaluation metric for unlearning effectiveness. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay among these mechanisms in maintaining system functionality and safety. This survey aims to fill the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations.</p></details> |  |

Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the effect of certain data points on the trained model parameters so that it can be approximately the same as if one retrains the model from scratch. This work proposes stochastic gradient Langevin unlearning, the first unlearning framework based on noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems under convexity assumption. Our results show that mini-batch gradient updates provide a superior privacy-complexity trade-off compared to the full-batch counterpart. There are numerous algorithmic benefits of our unlearning approach, including complexity saving compared to retraining, and supporting sequential and batch unlearning. To examine the privacy-utility-complexity trade-off of our method, we conduct experiments on benchmark datasets compared against prior works. Our approach achieves a similar utility under the same privacy constraint while using $2\%$ and $10\%$ of the gradient computations compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based approximate unlearning methods for mini-batch and full-batch settings, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.10371</p></details> |
| **[Unlearning Backdoor Threats: Enhancing Backdoor Defense in Multimodal Contrastive Learning via Local Token Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16257v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for building high-quality features using the complementary strengths of various data modalities. However, the open nature of such systems inadvertently increases the possibility of backdoor attacks. These attacks subtly embed malicious behaviors within the model during training, which can be activated by specific triggers in the inference phase, posing significant security risks. Despite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the adverse impacts of such attacks, these defenses often degrade the clean accuracy and necessitate the construction of extensive clean training pairs. In this paper, we explore the possibility of a less-cost defense from the perspective of model unlearning, that is, whether the model can be made to quickly \textbf{u}nlearn \textbf{b}ackdoor \textbf{t}hreats (UBT) by constructing a small set of poisoned samples. Specifically, we strengthen the backdoor shortcuts to discover suspicious samples through overfitting training prioritized by weak similarity samples. Building on the initial identification of suspicious samples, we introduce an innovative token-based localized forgetting training regime. This technique specifically targets the poisoned aspects of the model, applying a focused effort to unlearn the backdoor associations and trying not to damage the integrity of the overall model. Experimental results show that our method not only ensures a minimal success rate for attacks, but also preserves the model's high clean accuracy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The emerging discipline of Machine Unlearning has arisen as a pivotal area of research, facilitating the process of selectively discarding information designated to specific sets or classes of data from a pre-trained model, thereby eliminating the necessity for extensive retraining from scratch. The principal aim of this study is to formulate a methodology tailored for the purposeful elimination of information linked to a specific class of data from a pre-trained classification network. This intentional removal is crafted to degrade the model's performance specifically concerning the unlearned data class while concurrently minimizing any detrimental impacts on the model's performance in other classes. To achieve this goal, we frame the class unlearning problem from a Bayesian perspective, which yields a loss function that minimizes the log-likelihood associated with the unlearned data with a stability regularization in parameter space. This stability regularization incorporates Mohalanobis distance with respect to the Fisher Information matrix and $l_2$ distance from the pre-trained model parameters. Our novel approach, termed \textbf{Partially-Blinded Unlearning (PBU)}, surpasses existing state-of-the-art class unlearning methods, demonstrating superior effectiveness. Notably, PBU achieves this efficacy without requiring awareness of the entire training dataset but only to the unlearned data points, marking a distinctive feature of its performance.</p></details> |  |

For Now](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11868v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized the generation of realistic and complex images. However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as producing harmful content and infringing data copyrights. Despite the development of safety-driven unlearning techniques to counteract these challenges, doubts about their efficacy persist. To tackle this issue, we introduce an evaluation framework that leverages adversarial prompts to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-driven DMs after they have undergone the process of unlearning harmful concepts. Specifically, we investigated the adversarial robustness of DMs, assessed by adversarial prompts, when eliminating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects. We develop an effective and efficient adversarial prompt generation approach for DMs, termed UnlearnDiffAtk. This method capitalizes on the intrinsic classification abilities of DMs to simplify the creation of adversarial prompts, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary classification or diffusion models.Through extensive benchmarking, we evaluate the robustness of five widely-used safety-driven unlearned DMs (i.e., DMs after unlearning undesirable concepts, styles, or objects) across a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency merits of UnlearnDiffAtk over the state-of-the-art adversarial prompt generation method and reveal the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques when applied to DMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Diffusion-MU-Attack.

Nonetheless, they pose risks by potentially memorizing and disseminating sensitive, biased, or copyrighted information from their vast datasets. Machine unlearning emerges as a cutting-edge solution to mitigate these concerns, offering techniques for LLMs to selectively discard certain data. This paper reviews the latest in machine unlearning for LLMs, introducing methods for the targeted forgetting of information to address privacy, ethical, and legal challenges without necessitating full model retraining. It divides existing research into unlearning from unstructured/textual data and structured/classification data, showcasing the effectiveness of these approaches in removing specific data while maintaining model efficacy. Highlighting the practicality of machine unlearning, this analysis also points out the hurdles in preserving model integrity, avoiding excessive or insufficient data removal, and ensuring consistent outputs, underlining the role of machine unlearning in advancing responsible, ethical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\nabla τ$: Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14339v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks, including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$ requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Has Approximate Machine Unlearning been evaluated properly? From Auditing to Side Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12830v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing concerns surrounding data privacy and security have underscored the critical necessity for machine unlearning--aimed at fully removing data lineage from machine learning models. MLaaS providers expect this to be their ultimate safeguard for regulatory compliance. Despite its critical importance, the pace at which privacy communities have been developing and implementing strong methods to verify the effectiveness of machine unlearning has been disappointingly slow, with this vital area often receiving insufficient focus. This paper seeks to address this shortfall by introducing well-defined and effective metrics for black-box unlearning auditing tasks. We transform the auditing challenge into a question of non-membership inference and develop efficient metrics for auditing. By relying exclusively on the original and unlearned models--eliminating the need to train additional shadow models--our approach simplifies the evaluation of unlearning at the individual data point level. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct an in-depth analysis of current approximate machine unlearning algorithms, identifying three key directions where these approaches fall short: utility, resilience, and equity. Our aim is that this work will greatly improve our understanding of approximate machine unlearning methods, taking a significant stride towards converting the theoretical right to data erasure into a auditable reality.</p></details> |  |

Federated Unlearning (FU) consists in extending MU to unlearn a given client's contribution from a federated training routine. While several FU methods have been proposed, we currently lack a general approach providing formal unlearning guarantees to the FedAvg routine, while ensuring scalability and generalization beyond the convex assumption on the clients' loss functions. We aim at filling this gap by proposing SIFU (Sequential Informed Federated Unlearning), a new FU method applying to both convex and non-convex optimization regimes. SIFU naturally applies to FedAvg without additional computational cost for the clients and provides formal guarantees on the quality of the unlearning task. We provide a theoretical analysis of the unlearning properties of SIFU, and practically demonstrate its effectiveness as compared to a panel of unlearning methods from the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to selectively remove specific training data points' influence on trained models. This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of the solutions in machine unlearning. We categorize existing solutions into exact unlearning approaches that remove data influence thoroughly and approximate unlearning approaches that efficiently minimize data influence. By comprehensively reviewing solutions, we identify and discuss their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose future directions to advance machine unlearning and establish it as an essential capability for trustworthy and adaptive machine learning models. This paper provides researchers with a roadmap of open problems, encouraging impactful contributions to address real-world needs for selective data removal.</p></details> |  |

However, various issues (e.g. privacy leakage and copyright violation) of the training corpus still remain underexplored. For example, the Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for infringing on its copyrights by using millions of its articles for training. From the perspective of LLM practitioners, handling such unintended privacy violations can be challenging. Previous work addressed the ``unlearning" problem of LLMs using gradient information, while they mostly introduced significant overheads like data preprocessing or lacked robustness. In this paper, contrasting with the methods based on first-order information, we revisit the unlearning problem via the perspective of second-order information (Hessian). Our unlearning algorithms, which are inspired by classic Newton update, are not only data-agnostic/model-agnostic but also proven to be robust in terms of utility preservation or privacy guarantee. Through a comprehensive evaluation with four NLP datasets as well as a case study on real-world datasets, our methods consistently show superiority over the first-order methods.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge graph (KG) embedding representation provides a foundation for knowledge reasoning and applications by mapping entities and relations into vector space. Federated KG embedding enables the utilization of knowledge from diverse client sources while safeguarding the privacy of local data. However, due to demands such as privacy protection and the need to adapt to dynamic data changes, investigations into machine unlearning (MU) have been sparked. However, it is challenging to maintain the performance of KG embedding models while forgetting the influence of specific forgotten data on the model. In this paper, we propose FedDM, a novel framework tailored for machine unlearning in federated knowledge graphs. Leveraging diffusion models, we generate noisy data to sensibly mitigate the influence of specific knowledge on FL models while preserving the overall performance concerning the remaining data. We conduct experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets to assess the efficacy of the proposed model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDM yields promising results in knowledge forgetting.</p></details> |  |

Data users have been endowed with the right to be forgotten of their data. In the course of machine learning (ML), the forgotten right requires a model provider to delete user data and its subsequent impact on ML models upon user requests. Machine unlearning emerges to address this, which has garnered ever-increasing attention from both industry and academia. While the area has developed rapidly, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys to capture the latest advancements. Recognizing this shortage, we conduct an extensive exploration to map the landscape of machine unlearning including the (fine-grained) taxonomy of unlearning algorithms under centralized and distributed settings, debate on approximate unlearning, verification and evaluation metrics, challenges and solutions for unlearning under different applications, as well as attacks targeting machine unlearning. The survey concludes by outlining potential directions for future research, hoping to serve as a guide for interested scholars.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs may be trained on undesirable graph data, which can degrade their performance and reliability. To enable trained GNNs to efficiently unlearn unwanted data, a desirable solution is retraining-based graph unlearning, which partitions the training graph into subgraphs and trains sub-models on them, allowing fast unlearning through partial retraining. However, the graph partition process causes information loss in the training graph, resulting in the low model utility of sub-GNN models. In this paper, we propose GraphRevoker, a novel graph unlearning framework that better maintains the model utility of unlearnable GNNs. Specifically, we preserve the graph property with graph property-aware sharding and effectively aggregate the sub-GNN models for prediction with graph contrastive sub-model aggregation.

With the advent of regulations like the GDPR emphasizing data privacy and the right to be forgotten, machine learning models face the daunting task of unlearning sensitive information without compromising their integrity or performance. Our research introduces a novel approach that leverages influence functions and principles of distributional independence to address these challenges. By proposing a comprehensive framework for machine unlearning, we aim to ensure privacy protection while maintaining model performance and adaptability across varying distributions. Our method not only facilitates efficient data removal but also dynamically adjusts the model to preserve its generalization capabilities. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in scenarios characterized by significant distributional shifts, making substantial contributions to the field of machine unlearning. This research paves the way for developing more resilient and adaptable unlearning techniques, ensuring models remain robust and accurate in the dynamic landscape of data privacy and machine learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Deletion from Trained Models through Layer-wise Partial Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07611v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning has garnered significant attention due to its ability to selectively erase knowledge obtained from specific training data samples in an already trained machine learning model. This capability enables data holders to adhere strictly to data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning techniques face practical constraints, often causing performance degradation, demanding brief fine-tuning post unlearning, and requiring significant storage. In response, this paper introduces a novel class of machine unlearning algorithms. First method is partial amnesiac unlearning, integration of layer-wise pruning with amnesiac unlearning. In this method, updates made to the model during training are pruned and stored, subsequently used to forget specific data from trained model. The second method assimilates layer-wise partial-updates into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning to mitigate the adverse effects of data deletion on model efficacy. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, we showcase the effectiveness of proposed unlearning methods. Experimental results highlight that the partial amnesiac unlearning not only preserves model efficacy but also eliminates the necessity for brief post fine-tuning, unlike conventional amnesiac unlearning. Moreover, employing layer-wise partial updates in label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning techniques demonstrates superiority in preserving model efficacy compared to their naive counterparts.</p></details> | 16pages, 4 figures |
| **[Challenging Forgets: Unveiling the Worst-Case Forget Sets in Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07362v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively 'unlearning' data points after training. This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies. Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.

This concept is pivotal in enforcing the \textit{right to be forgotten}, which entails the selective removal of specific data from trained GNNs upon user request. Our research focuses on edge unlearning, a process of particular relevance to real-world applications. Current state-of-the-art approaches like GNNDelete can eliminate the influence of specific edges yet suffer from \textit{over-forgetting}, which means the unlearning process inadvertently removes excessive information beyond needed, leading to a significant performance decline for remaining edges. Our analysis identifies the loss functions of GNNDelete as the primary source of over-forgetting and also suggests that loss functions may be redundant for effective edge unlearning. Building on these insights, we simplify GNNDelete to develop \textbf{Unlink to Unlearn} (UtU), a novel method that facilitates unlearning exclusively through unlinking the forget edges from graph structure. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UtU delivers privacy protection on par with that of a retrained model while preserving high accuracy in downstream tasks, by upholding over 97.3\% of the retrained model's privacy protection capabilities and 99.8\% of its link prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, UtU requires only constant computational demands, underscoring its advantage as a highly lightweight and practical edge unlearning solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2024 as a Short Research Paper</p></details> |
| **[Post-Training Attribute Unlearning in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06737v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing privacy concerns in recommender systems, recommendation unlearning is getting increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly use training data, i.e., model inputs, as unlearning target. However, attackers can extract private information from the model even if it has not been explicitly encountered during training. We name this unseen information as \textit{attribute} and treat it as unlearning target. To protect the sensitive attribute of users, Attribute Unlearning (AU) aims to make target attributes indistinguishable. In this paper, we focus on a strict but practical setting of AU, namely Post-Training Attribute Unlearning (PoT-AU), where unlearning can only be performed after the training of the recommendation model is completed. To address the PoT-AU problem in recommender systems, we propose a two-component loss function. The first component is distinguishability loss, where we design a distribution-based measurement to make attribute labels indistinguishable from attackers. We further extend this measurement to handle multi-class attribute cases with efficient computational overhead. The second component is regularization loss, where we explore a function-space measurement that effectively maintains recommendation performance compared to parameter-space regularization. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm to optimize our proposed loss. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05847</p></details> |
| **[Task-Aware Machine Unlearning and Its Application in Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14412v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data privacy and security have become a non-negligible factor in load forecasting. Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement. However, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e., remove the impact of) part of training data if the these data are found to be malicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning which is specifically designed to remove the influence of part of the dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct unlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance between unlearning completeness and model performance, a performance-aware algorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local model parameter change using influence function and sample re-weighting. Furthermore, we observe that the statistical criterion such as mean squared error, cannot fully reflect the operation cost of the downstream tasks in power system. Therefore, a task-aware machine unlearning is proposed whose objective is a trilevel optimization with dispatch and redispatch problems considered. We theoretically prove the existence of the gradient of such an objective, which is key to re-weighting the remaining samples. We tested the unlearning algorithms on linear, CNN, and MLP-Mixer based load forecasters with a realistic load dataset. The simulation demonstrates the balance between unlearning completeness and operational cost.

| **[Learning the Unlearned: Mitigating Feature Suppression in Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11816v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning has proven effective in deriving high-quality representations from unlabeled data. However, a major challenge that hinders both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning is feature suppression, a phenomenon where the trained model captures only a limited portion of the information from the input data while overlooking other potentially valuable content. This issue often leads to indistinguishable representations for visually similar but semantically different inputs, adversely affecting downstream task performance, particularly those requiring rigorous semantic comprehension. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model-agnostic Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework. Unlike standard contrastive learning which inherently captures one single biased feature distribution, MCL progressively learns previously unlearned features through feature-aware negative sampling at each stage, where the negative samples of an anchor are exclusively selected from the cluster it was assigned to in preceding stages. Meanwhile, MCL preserves the previously well-learned features by cross-stage representation integration, integrating features across all stages to form final representations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MCL's effectiveness and superiority across both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning, spanning a range of model architectures from ResNet to Vision Transformers (ViT). Remarkably, in tasks where the original CLIP model has shown limitations, MCL dramatically enhances performance, with improvements up to threefold on specific attributes in the recently proposed MMVP benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai</p></details> | <details><summary>See t...</summary><p>See the project page at https://wmdp.ai</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient and Effective Unlearning of Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03536v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) give rise to a promising research direction, i.e., leveraging LLMs as recommenders (LLMRec). The efficacy of LLMRec arises from the open-world knowledge and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. LLMRec acquires the recommendation capabilities through instruction tuning based on user interaction data. However, in order to protect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to intentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as recommendation unlearning. In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses new challenges for LLMRec in terms of \textit{inefficiency} and \textit{ineffectiveness}. Existing unlearning methods require updating billions of parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming. Besides, they always impact the model utility during the unlearning process. To this end, we propose \textbf{E2URec}, the first \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{U}nlearning method for LLM\underline{Rec}. Our proposed E2URec enhances the unlearning efficiency by updating only a few additional LoRA parameters, and improves the unlearning effectiveness by employing a teacher-student framework, where we maintain multiple teacher networks to guide the unlearning process. Extensive experiments show that E2URec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets. Specifically, E2URec can efficiently forget specific data without affecting recommendation performance. The source code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/E2URec}.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Guardrail Baselines for Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03329v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated that fine-tuning is a promising approach to `unlearn' concepts from large language models. However, fine-tuning can be expensive, as it requires both generating a set of examples and running iterations of fine-tuning to update the model. In this work, we show that simple guardrail-based approaches such as prompting and filtering can achieve unlearning results comparable to fine-tuning. We recommend that researchers investigate these lightweight baselines when evaluating the performance of more computationally intensive fine-tuning methods. While we do not claim that methods such as prompting or filtering are universal solutions to the problem of unlearning, our work suggests the need for evaluation metrics that can better separate the power of guardrails vs. fine-tuning, and highlights scenarios where guardrails themselves may be advantageous for unlearning, such as in generating examples for fine-tuning or unlearning when only API access is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, accepted to ICLR workshop SeT-LLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[SoK: Challenges and Opportunities in Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02437v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL), introduced in 2017, facilitates collaborative learning between non-trusting parties with no need for the parties to explicitly share their data among themselves. This allows training models on user data while respecting privacy regulations such as GDPR and CPRA. However, emerging privacy requirements may mandate model owners to be able to \emph{forget} some learned data, e.g., when requested by data owners or law enforcement. This has given birth to an active field of research called \emph{machine unlearning}. In the context of FL, many techniques developed for unlearning in centralized settings are not trivially applicable! This is due to the unique differences between centralized and distributed learning, in particular, interactivity, stochasticity, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility in FL. In response, a recent line of work has focused on developing unlearning mechanisms tailored to FL. This SoK paper aims to take a deep look at the \emph{federated unlearning} literature, with the goal of identifying research trends and challenges in this emerging field. By carefully categorizing papers published on FL unlearning (since 2020), we aim to pinpoint the unique complexities of federated unlearning, highlighting limitations on directly applying centralized unlearning methods. We compare existing federated unlearning methods regarding influence removal and performance recovery, compare their threat models and assumptions, and discuss their implications and limitations. For instance, we analyze the experimental setup of FL unlearning studies from various perspectives, including data heterogeneity and its simulation, the datasets used for demonstration, and evaluation metrics. Our work aims to offer insights and suggestions for future research on federated unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Language Models: Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01267v1)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and shaping the behaviour of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important as applications become more powerful and more frequently adopted. This paper introduces a machine unlearning method specifically designed for LLMs. We introduce a selective pruning method for LLMs that removes neurons based on their relative importance on a targeted capability compared to overall network performance. This approach is a compute- and data-efficient method for identifying and removing neurons that enable specific behaviours. Our findings reveal that both feed-forward and attention neurons in LLMs are specialized; that is, for specific tasks, certain neurons are more crucial than others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inexact Unlearning Needs More Careful Evaluations to Avoid a False Sense of Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01218v1)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of model training makes it increasingly desirable to develop techniques for unlearning. These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their ``U-MIA'' counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into ``population U-MIAs'', where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and ``per-example U-MIAs'', where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail to alleviate these issues.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often suffer limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' for MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting data points). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach that can effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation tasks. As highlighted below, For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not.

Most existing machine unlearning approaches require a model to be fine-tuned to remove information while preserving performance. This is computationally expensive and necessitates the storage of the whole dataset for the lifetime of the model. Retraining-free approaches often utilise Fisher information, which is derived from the loss and requires labelled data which may not be available. Thus, we present an extension to the Selective Synaptic Dampening algorithm, substituting the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix for the gradient of the l2 norm of the model output to approximate sensitivity. We evaluate our method in a range of experiments using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer. Results show our label-free method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Tiny Paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we first survey techniques and limitations of existing unlearning evaluations. Second, we apply a comprehensive set of tests for the robustness and competitiveness of unlearning in the "Who's Harry Potter" (WHP) model from Eldan and Russinovich (2023). While WHP's unlearning generalizes well when evaluated with the "Familiarity" metric from Eldan and Russinovich, we find i) higher-than-baseline amounts of knowledge can reliably be extracted, ii) WHP performs on par with the original model on Harry Potter Q&A tasks, iii) it represents latent knowledge comparably to the original model, and iv) there is collateral unlearning in related domains. Overall, our results highlight the importance of comprehensive unlearning evaluation that avoids ad-hoc metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnlearnCanvas: A Stylized Image Dataset to Benchmark Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11846v2)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models (DMs) has not only transformed various real-world industries but has also introduced negative societal concerns, including the generation of harmful content, copyright disputes, and the rise of stereotypes and biases. To mitigate these issues, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a potential solution, demonstrating its ability to remove undesired generative capabilities of DMs in various applications. However, by examining existing MU evaluation methods, we uncover several key challenges that can result in incomplete, inaccurate, or biased evaluations for MU in DMs. To address them, we enhance the evaluation metrics for MU, including the introduction of an often-overlooked retainability measurement for DMs post-unlearning. Additionally, we introduce UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates us to evaluate the unlearning of artistic painting styles in conjunction with associated image objects. We show that this dataset plays a pivotal role in establishing a standardized and automated evaluation framework for MU techniques on DMs, featuring 7 quantitative metrics to address various aspects of unlearning effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 5 state-of-the-art MU methods, revealing novel insights into their pros and cons, and the underlying unlearning mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of UnlearnCanvas to benchmark other generative modeling tasks, such as style transfer.

| **[Decentralized Federated Unlearning on Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16294v1)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchained Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining traction for ensuring the integrity and traceability of FL processes. Blockchained FL involves participants training models locally with their data and subsequently publishing the models on the blockchain, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-like inheritance structure that represents the model relationship. However, this particular DAG-based structure presents challenges in updating models with sensitive data, due to the complexity and overhead involved. To address this, we propose Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a generic framework that redesigns the blockchain structure using Chameleon Hash (CH) technology to mitigate the complexity of model updating, thereby reducing the computational and consensus costs of unlearning tasks.Furthermore, BlockFUL supports various federated unlearning methods, ensuring the integrity and traceability of model updates, whether conducted in parallel or serial. We conduct a comprehensive study of two typical unlearning methods, gradient ascent and re-training, demonstrating the efficient unlearning workflow in these two categories with minimal CH and block update operations. Additionally, we compare the computation and communication costs of these methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine unlearning through fine-grained model parameters perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04385v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning techniques, which involve retracting data records and reducing influence of said data on trained models, help with the user privacy protection objective but incur significant computational costs. Weight perturbation-based unlearning is a general approach, but it typically involves globally modifying the parameters. We propose fine-grained Top-K and Random-k parameters perturbed inexact machine unlearning strategies that address the privacy needs while keeping the computational costs tractable. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of our strategies we also tackle the challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of machine unlearning by considering the model's generalization performance across both unlearning and remaining data. To better assess the unlearning effect and model generalization, we propose novel metrics, namely, the forgetting rate and memory retention rate. However, for inexact machine unlearning, current metrics are inadequate in quantifying the degree of forgetting that occurs after unlearning strategies are applied. To address this, we introduce SPD-GAN, which subtly perturbs the distribution of data targeted for unlearning. Then, we evaluate the degree of unlearning by measuring the performance difference of the models on the perturbed unlearning data before and after the unlearning process. By implementing these innovative techniques and metrics, we achieve computationally efficacious privacy protection in machine learning applications without significant sacrifice of model performance. Furthermore, this approach provides a novel method for evaluating the degree of unlearning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we start from the fundamental distinction between training data and unseen data on their contribution to the model: the training data contributes to the final model while the unseen data does not. We theoretically discover that the input sensitivity can approximately measure the contribution and practically design an algorithm, called MU-Mis (machine unlearning via minimizing input sensitivity), to suppress the contribution of the forgetting data. Experimental results demonstrate that MU-Mis outperforms state-of-the-art MU methods significantly. Additionally, MU-Mis aligns more closely with the application of MU as it does not require the use of remaining data.</p></details> |  |

The primary objective of MU is to erase the influence of specific data samples on a given model without the need to retrain it from scratch. Accordingly, existing methods focus on maximizing user privacy protection. However, there are different degrees of privacy regulations for each real-world web-based application. Exploring the full spectrum of trade-offs between privacy, model utility, and runtime efficiency is critical for practical unlearning scenarios. Furthermore, designing the MU algorithm with simple control of the aforementioned trade-off is desirable but challenging due to the inherent complex interaction. To address the challenges, we present Controllable Machine Unlearning (ConMU), a novel framework designed to facilitate the calibration of MU. The ConMU framework contains three integral modules: an important data selection module that reconciles the runtime efficiency and model generalization, a progressive Gaussian mechanism module that balances privacy and model generalization, and an unlearning proxy that controls the trade-offs between privacy and runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets have demonstrated the robust adaptability of our control mechanism and its superiority over established unlearning methods. ConMU explores the full spectrum of the Privacy-Utility-Efficiency trade-off and allows practitioners to account for different real-world regulations.

We study what model developers can do if they detect that some data was manipulated or incorrect. Such manipulated data can cause adverse effects like vulnerability to backdoored samples, systematic biases, and in general, reduced accuracy on certain input domains. Often, all manipulated training samples are not known, and only a small, representative subset of the affected data is flagged. We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples. We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning. We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning. However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting. We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15910v4)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, known as \emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference attack'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10683v2)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to perform unlearning, i.e. forgetting undesirable misbehaviors, on large language models (LLMs). We show at least three scenarios of aligning LLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmful responses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3) reducing hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has three advantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which are much easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting) than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in RLHF (RL from human feedback). (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It is especially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLM unlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, and evaluations in LLM unlearning. We show that if practitioners only have limited resources, and therefore the priority is to stop generating undesirable outputs rather than to try to generate desirable outputs, unlearning is particularly appealing. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows that unlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just 2% of its computational time.</p></details> |  |

Instead of centralizing raw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global model incrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to be forgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their data contributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it is recognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global model through updates, e.g. to generate mispredictions on specially crafted data examples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guarantee individuals the possibility to remove their data and erase malicious contributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired "good" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel Federated Unlearning (FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributions without full model retraining. This survey provides background concepts, empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FU schemes. Our study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluating unlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizing state-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy. Finally, we outline the most relevant and still open technical challenges, by identifying the most promising research directions in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, and 6 tables</p></details> |

This principle allows individuals to request that their personal data be deleted from deployed machine learning models. While "forgetting" can be naively achieved by retraining on the remaining dataset, it is computationally expensive to do to so with each new request. As such, several machine unlearning methods have been proposed as efficient alternatives to retraining. These methods aim to approximate the predictive performance of retraining, but fail to consider how unlearning impacts other properties critical to real-world applications such as fairness. In this work, we demonstrate that most efficient unlearning methods cannot accommodate popular fairness interventions, and we propose the first fair machine unlearning method that can efficiently unlearn data instances from a fair objective. We derive theoretical results which demonstrate that our method can provably unlearn data and provably maintain fairness performance. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets highlight the efficacy of our method at unlearning data instances while preserving fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted to AISTATS 2024.

This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safer Large Language Models through Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10058v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated their vast potential across various domains, attributed to their extensive pretraining knowledge and exceptional generalizability. However, LLMs often encounter challenges in generating harmful content when faced with problematic prompts. To address this problem, existing work attempted to implement a gradient ascent based approach to prevent LLMs from producing harmful output. While these methods can be effective, they frequently impact the model utility in responding to normal prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Selective Knowledge negation Unlearning (SKU), a novel unlearning framework for LLMs, designed to eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving utility on normal prompts. Specifically, SKU is consisted of two stages: harmful knowledge acquisition stage and knowledge negation stage. The first stage aims to identify and acquire harmful knowledge within the model, whereas the second is dedicated to remove this knowledge. SKU selectively isolates and removes harmful knowledge in model parameters, ensuring the model's performance remains robust on normal prompts. Our experiments conducted across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SKU identifies a good balance point between removing harmful information and preserving utility.</p></details> | 13 pages in total |

To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we borrow the idea of unlearning and propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which can eliminate hallucinations without the need for paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09063v1)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trigg...</summary><p>Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment</p></details> |

We capitalize on the capabilities of strong Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to facilitate the unlearning of specific samples from a trained model. We consider the scenario of two networks, the attacker $\mathbf{A}$ and the trained defender $\mathbf{D}$ pitted against each other in an adversarial objective, wherein the attacker aims at teasing out the information of the data to be unlearned in order to infer membership, and the defender unlearns to defend the network against the attack, whilst preserving its general performance. The algorithm can be trained end-to-end using backpropagation, following the well known iterative min-max approach in updating the attacker and the defender. We additionally incorporate a self-supervised objective effectively addressing the feature space discrepancies between the forget set and the validation set, enhancing unlearning performance. Our proposed algorithm closely approximates the ideal benchmark of retraining from scratch for both random sample forgetting and class-wise forgetting schemes on standard machine-unlearning datasets. Specifically, on the class unlearning scheme, the method demonstrates near-optimal performance and comprehensively overcomes known methods over the random sample forgetting scheme across all metrics and multiple network pruning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including references, 2 tables, 2 figures and 1 algorithm</p></details> |

We introduce key metrics for FU assessment, concentrating on verification, global stability, and local fairness, and investigate the inherent trade-offs. Furthermore, we formulate the unlearning process with data heterogeneity through an optimization framework. Our key contribution lies in a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the trade-offs in FU and provides insights into data heterogeneity's impacts on FU. Leveraging these insights, we propose FU mechanisms to manage the trade-offs, guiding further development for FU mechanisms. We empirically validate that our FU mechanisms effectively balance trade-offs, confirming insights derived from our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Here, a novel approach is introduced to achieve precise and selective forgetting within language models. Unlike previous methodologies that adopt completely opposing training objectives, this approach aims to mitigate adverse effects on language model performance, particularly in generation tasks. Furthermore, two innovative evaluation metrics are proposed: Sensitive Information Extraction Likelihood (S-EL) and Sensitive Information Memory Accuracy (S-MA), designed to gauge the effectiveness of sensitive information elimination. To reinforce the forgetting framework, an effective method for annotating sensitive scopes is presented, involving both online and offline strategies. The online selection mechanism leverages language probability scores to ensure computational efficiency, while the offline annotation entails a robust two-stage process based on Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |

Researchers have provided a probabilistic notion of approximate unlearning under a similar definition of Differential Privacy (DP), where privacy is defined as statistical indistinguishability to retraining from scratch. We propose Langevin unlearning, an unlearning framework based on noisy gradient descent with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems. Langevin unlearning unifies the DP learning process and the privacy-certified unlearning process with many algorithmic benefits. These include approximate certified unlearning for non-convex problems, complexity saving compared to retraining, sequential and batch unlearning for multiple unlearning requests. We verify the practicality of Langevin unlearning by studying its privacy-utility-complexity trade-off via experiments on benchmark datasets, and also demonstrate its superiority against gradient-decent-plus-output-perturbation based approximate unlearning.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity and power, these models have been found to produce unexpected or discriminatory outcomes. Given their overwhelming success for most tasks, it is of interest to identify sources of their unexpected and discriminatory behavior. However, there has not been much work on understanding and debugging tree-based classifiers in the context of fairness. We introduce FairDebugger, a system that utilizes recent advances in machine unlearning research to identify training data subsets responsible for instances of fairness violations in the outcomes of a random forest classifier. FairDebugger generates top-$k$ explanations (in the form of coherent training data subsets) for model unfairness. Toward this goal, FairDebugger first utilizes machine unlearning to estimate the change in the tree structures of the random forest when parts of the underlying training data are removed, and then leverages the Apriori algorithm from frequent itemset mining to reduce the subset search space. We empirically evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets, and demonstrate that the explanations generated by FairDebugger are consistent with insights from prior studies on these datasets.</p></details> |  |

When a model has been trained on a dataset containing such errors its performance is reduced. This leads to the challenge of efficiently unlearning the influence of the erroneous data to improve the model performance without needing to completely retrain the model. While model editing methods exist for cases in which the correct label for a wrong entry is known, we focus on the case of data entry errors where we do not know the correct labels for the erroneous data. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an extension to the selective synaptic dampening unlearning method that removes the need for parameter tuning, making unlearning accessible to practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of this extension, adaptive selective synaptic dampening (ASSD), on various ResNet18 and Vision Transformer unlearning tasks. Second, we demonstrate the performance of ASSD in a supply chain delay prediction problem with labelling errors using real-world data where we randomly introduce various levels of labelling errors. The application of this approach is particularly compelling in industrial settings, such as supply chain management, where a significant portion of data entry occurs manually through Excel sheets, rendering it error-prone. ASSD shows strong performance on general unlearning benchmarks and on the error correction problem where it outperforms fine-tuning for error correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Federated Unlearning: A Taxonomy, Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19218v3)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) has led to an increasing demand for implementing the right to be forgotten. The implementation of selective forgetting is particularly challenging in FL due to its decentralized nature. This complexity has given rise to a new field, Federated Unlearning (FU). FU emerges as a strategic solution to address the increasing need for data privacy, including the implementation of the `right to be forgotten'. The primary challenge in developing FU approaches lies in balancing the trade-offs in privacy, security, utility, and efficiency, as these elements often have competing requirements. Achieving an optimal equilibrium among these facets is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and usability of FL systems while adhering to privacy and security standards. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of existing FU methods, incorporating a detailed review of the various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we unify these diverse methods and metrics into an experimental framework. Additionally, the survey discusses potential future research directions in FU.

The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. Under such a definition, existing state-of-the-art methods are insufficient. Building on the concepts of Lipschitz continuity, we present a method that induces smoothing of the forget sample's output, with respect to perturbations of that sample. We show this smoothing successfully results in forgetting while preserving general model performance. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearnable Examples For Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02028v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable examples (UEs) refer to training samples modified to be unlearnable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These examples are usually generated by adding error-minimizing noises that can fool a DNN model into believing that there is nothing (no error) to learn from the data. The concept of UE has been proposed as a countermeasure against unauthorized data exploitation on personal data. While UE has been extensively studied on images, it is unclear how to craft effective UEs for time series data. In this work, we introduce the first UE generation method to protect time series data from unauthorized training by deep learning models. To this end, we propose a new form of error-minimizing noise that can be \emph{selectively} applied to specific segments of time series, rendering them unlearnable to DNN models while remaining imperceptible to human observers. Through extensive experiments on a wide range of time series datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed UE generation method is effective in both classification and generation tasks. It can protect time series data against unauthorized exploitation, while preserving their utility for legitimate usage, thereby contributing to the development of secure and trustworthy machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |

Challenges related to privacy and model efficiency arise from the use of outdated, private, and irrelevant data. These issues compromise both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of models in both Machine Learning and Unlearning. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRAMU). This framework incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms, privacy preservation techniques, and optimization strategies, making it a well-rounded solution for handling various data sources, either single-modality or multi-modality, while maintaining accuracy and privacy. FRAMU's strength lies in its adaptability to fluctuating data landscapes, its ability to unlearn outdated, private, or irrelevant data, and its support for continual model evolution without compromising privacy. Our experiments, conducted on both single-modality and multi-modality datasets, revealed that FRAMU significantly outperformed baseline models. Additional assessments of convergence behavior and optimization strategies further validate the framework's utility in federated learning applications. Overall, FRAMU advances Machine Unlearning by offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution that optimizes model performance while also addressing key challenges in dynamic data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, existing machine unlearning methods have been primarily focused on classification models, leaving the landscape of unlearning for generative models relatively unexplored. This paper serves as a bridge, addressing the gap by providing a unifying framework of machine unlearning for image-to-image generative models. Within this framework, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm, underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, that demonstrates negligible performance degradation on the retain samples, while effectively removing the information from the forget samples. Empirical studies on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places-365, further show that our algorithm does not rely on the availability of the retain samples, which further complies with data retention policy. To our best knowledge, this work is the first that represents systemic, theoretical, empirical explorations of machine unlearning specifically tailored for image-to-image generative models.

| **[Unlearnable Algorithms for In-context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00751v1)** | 2024-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a desirable operation as models get increasingly deployed on data with unknown provenance. However, achieving exact unlearning -- obtaining a model that matches the model distribution when the data to be forgotten was never used -- is challenging or inefficient, often requiring significant retraining. In this paper, we focus on efficient unlearning methods for the task adaptation phase of a pretrained large language model (LLM). We observe that an LLM's ability to do in-context learning for task adaptation allows for efficient exact unlearning of task adaptation training data. We provide an algorithm for selecting few-shot training examples to prepend to the prompt given to an LLM (for task adaptation), ERASE, whose unlearning operation cost is independent of model and dataset size, meaning it scales to large models and datasets. We additionally compare our approach to fine-tuning approaches and discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches. This leads us to propose a new holistic measure of unlearning cost which accounts for varying inference costs, and conclude that in-context learning can often be more favourable than fine-tuning for deployments involving unlearning requests.</p></details> |  |

MLaaS provides inference service with low inference latency based on an ML model trained using a dataset collected from numerous individual data owners. Recently, for the sake of data owners' privacy and to comply with the "right to be forgotten (RTBF)" as enacted by data protection legislation, many machine unlearning methods have been proposed to remove data owners' data from trained models upon their unlearning requests. However, despite their promising efficiency, almost all existing machine unlearning methods handle unlearning requests independently from inference requests, which unfortunately introduces a new security issue of inference service obsolescence and a privacy vulnerability of undesirable exposure for machine unlearning in MLaaS. In this paper, we propose the ERASER framework for machinE unleaRning in MLaAS via an inferencE seRving-aware approach. ERASER strategically choose appropriate unlearning execution timing to address the inference service obsolescence issue. A novel inference consistency certification mechanism is proposed to avoid the violation of RTBF principle caused by postponed unlearning executions, thereby mitigating the undesirable exposure vulnerability. ERASER offers three groups of design choices to allow for tailor-made variants that best suit the specific environments and preferences of various MLaaS systems. Extensive empirical evaluations across various settings confirm ERASER's effectiveness, e.g., it can effectively save up to 99% of inference latency and 31% of computation overhead over the inference-oblivion baseline.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dataset Condensation Driven Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00195v1)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current trend in data regulation requirements and privacy-preserving machine learning has emphasized the importance of machine unlearning. The naive approach to unlearning training data by retraining over the complement of the forget samples is susceptible to computational challenges. These challenges have been effectively addressed through a collection of techniques falling under the umbrella of machine unlearning. However, there still exists a lack of sufficiency in handling persistent computational challenges in harmony with the utility and privacy of unlearned model. We attribute this to the lack of work on improving the computational complexity of approximate unlearning from the perspective of the training dataset. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by introducing dataset condensation as an essential component of machine unlearning in the context of image classification. To achieve this goal, we propose new dataset condensation techniques and an innovative unlearning scheme that strikes a balance between machine unlearning privacy, utility, and efficiency. Furthermore, we present a novel and effective approach to instrumenting machine unlearning and propose its application in defending against membership inference and model inversion attacks. Additionally, we explore a new application of our approach, which involves removing data from `condensed model', which can be employed to quickly train any arbitrary model without being influenced by unlearning samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game-Theoretic Unlearnable Example Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17523v1)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable example attacks are data poisoning attacks aiming to degrade the clean test accuracy of deep learning by adding imperceptible perturbations to the training samples, which can be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. However, directly solving this optimization problem is intractable for deep neural networks. In this paper, we investigate unlearnable example attacks from a game-theoretic perspective, by formulating the attack as a nonzero sum Stackelberg game. First, the existence of game equilibria is proved under the normal setting and the adversarial training setting. It is shown that the game equilibrium gives the most powerful poison attack in that the victim has the lowest test accuracy among all networks within the same hypothesis space, when certain loss functions are used. Second, we propose a novel attack method, called the Game Unlearnable Example (GUE), which has three main gradients. (1) The poisons are obtained by directly solving the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game with a first-order algorithm. (2) We employ an autoencoder-like generative network model as the poison attacker. (3) A novel payoff function is introduced to evaluate the performance of the poison. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GUE can effectively poison the model in various scenarios. Furthermore, the GUE still works by using a relatively small percentage of the training data to train the generator, and the poison generator can generalize to unseen data well. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/hong-xian/gue.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaMU: Disentangling Causal Effects in Deep Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17504v1)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning requires removing the information of forgetting data while keeping the necessary information of remaining data. Despite recent advancements in this area, existing methodologies mainly focus on the effect of removing forgetting data without considering the negative impact this can have on the information of the remaining data, resulting in significant performance degradation after data removal. Although some methods try to repair the performance of remaining data after removal, the forgotten information can also return after repair. Such an issue is due to the intricate intertwining of the forgetting and remaining data. Without adequately differentiating the influence of these two kinds of data on the model, existing algorithms take the risk of either inadequate removal of the forgetting data or unnecessary loss of valuable information from the remaining data. To address this shortcoming, the present study undertakes a causal analysis of the unlearning and introduces a novel framework termed Causal Machine Unlearning (CaMU). This framework adds intervention on the information of remaining data to disentangle the causal effects between forgetting data and remaining data. Then CaMU eliminates the causal impact associated with forgetting data while concurrently preserving the causal relevance of the remaining data. Comprehensive empirical results on various datasets and models suggest that CaMU enhances performance on the remaining data and effectively minimizes the influences of forgetting data. Notably, this work is the first to interpret deep model unlearning tasks from a new perspective of causality and provide a solution based on causal analysis, which opens up new possibilities for future research in deep model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper accepted for the SDM 24 conference</p></details> |

Consequently, given the extensive adoption of data-intensive machine learning (ML) algorithms and increasing concerns for personal data privacy protection, the concept of machine unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention. MU empowers an ML model to selectively eliminate sensitive or personally identifiable information it acquired during the training process. Evolving from the foundational principles of MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within the domain of federated learning (FL) settings. This empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client while preserving the integrity of the decentralized learning process. Nevertheless, unlike traditional MU, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges lead to the need for tailored design when designing FU algorithms. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques, methodologies, and recent advancements in federated unlearning. It provides an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluates existing federated unlearning algorithms, reviews optimizations tailored to federated learning, engages in discussions regarding practical applications, along with an assessment of their limitations, and outlines promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Federated Unlearning via Isolated and Coded Sharding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15957v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated unlearning has emerged as a promising paradigm to erase the client-level data effect without affecting the performance of collaborative learning models. However, the federated unlearning process often introduces extensive storage overhead and consumes substantial computational resources, thus hindering its implementation in practice. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable federated unlearning framework based on isolated sharding and coded computing. We first divide distributed clients into multiple isolated shards across stages to reduce the number of clients being affected. Then, to reduce the storage overhead of the central server, we develop a coded computing mechanism by compressing the model parameters across different shards. In addition, we provide the theoretical analysis of time efficiency and storage effectiveness for the isolated and coded sharding. Finally, extensive experiments on two typical learning tasks, i.e., classification and generation, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve better performance than three state-of-the-art frameworks in terms of accuracy, retraining time, storage overhead, and F1 scores for resisting membership inference attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15917v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated unlearning is a promising paradigm for protecting the data ownership of distributed clients. It allows central servers to remove historical data effects within the machine learning model as well as address the "right to be forgotten" issue in federated learning. However, existing works require central servers to retain the historical model parameters from distributed clients, such that allows the central server to utilize these parameters for further training even, after the clients exit the training process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new blockchain-enabled trustworthy federated unlearning framework. We first design a proof of federated unlearning protocol, which utilizes the Chameleon hash function to verify data removal and eliminate the data contributions stored in other clients' models. Then, an adaptive contribution-based retraining mechanism is developed to reduce the computational overhead and significantly improve the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a better data removal effect than the state-of-the-art frameworks, marking a significant stride towards trustworthy federated unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning Reveals the Influential Training Data of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15241v1)** | 2024-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to enhance the performance of language models while mitigating the risks of generating harmful content, it is crucial to identify which training dataset affects the model's outputs. Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac, which estimates the influence of a training dataset by unlearning it from the trained model. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. We empirically examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Experimental results demonstrate that our method estimates their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple model checkpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effective and General Graph Unlearning via Mutual Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11760v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of AI applications, the growing needs for data privacy and model robustness have highlighted the importance of machine unlearning, especially in thriving graph-based scenarios. However, most existing graph unlearning strategies primarily rely on well-designed architectures or manual process, rendering them less user-friendly and posing challenges in terms of deployment efficiency. Furthermore, striking a balance between unlearning performance and framework generalization is also a pivotal concern. To address the above issues, we propose \underline{\textbf{M}}utual \underline{\textbf{E}}volution \underline{\textbf{G}}raph \underline{\textbf{U}}nlearning (MEGU), a new mutual evolution paradigm that simultaneously evolves the predictive and unlearning capacities of graph unlearning. By incorporating aforementioned two components, MEGU ensures complementary optimization in a unified training framework that aligns with the prediction and unlearning requirements. Extensive experiments on 9 graph benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MEGU in addressing unlearning requirements at the feature, node, and edge levels. Specifically, MEGU achieves average performance improvements of 2.7\%, 2.5\%, and 3.2\% across these three levels of unlearning tasks when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, MEGU exhibits satisfactory training efficiency, reducing time and space overhead by an average of 159.8x and 9.6x, respectively, in comparison to retraining GNN from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Communication Efficient and Provable Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11018v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study federated unlearning, a novel problem to eliminate the impact of specific clients or data points on the global model learned via federated learning (FL). This problem is driven by the right to be forgotten and the privacy challenges in FL. We introduce a new framework for exact federated unlearning that meets two essential criteria: \textit{communication efficiency} and \textit{exact unlearning provability}. To our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle both aspects coherently. We start by giving a rigorous definition of \textit{exact} federated unlearning, which guarantees that the unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without the deleted data. We then pinpoint the key property that enables fast exact federated unlearning: total variation (TV) stability, which measures the sensitivity of the model parameters to slight changes in the dataset. Leveraging this insight, we develop a TV-stable FL algorithm called \texttt{FATS}, which modifies the classical \texttt{\underline{F}ed\underline{A}vg} algorithm for \underline{T}V \underline{S}tability and employs local SGD with periodic averaging to lower the communication round. We also design efficient unlearning algorithms for \texttt{FATS} under two settings: client-level and sample-level unlearning. We provide theoretical guarantees for our learning and unlearning algorithms, proving that they achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models. We empirically validate our framework on 6 benchmark datasets, and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation cost, and unlearning efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Unlearning: A Contrastive Approach to Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10458v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of a subset of training samples (i.e., unlearning samples) from a trained model. Effectively and efficiently removing the unlearning samples without negatively impacting the overall model performance is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive unlearning framework, leveraging the concept of representation learning for more effective unlearning. It removes the influence of unlearning samples by contrasting their embeddings against the remaining samples so that they are pushed away from their original classes and pulled toward other classes. By directly optimizing the representation space, it effectively removes the influence of unlearning samples while maintaining the representations learned from the remaining samples. Experiments on a variety of datasets and models on both class unlearning and sample unlearning showed that contrastive unlearning achieves the best unlearning effects and efficiency with the lowest performance loss compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While parameter-efficient modules (PEMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in equipping models with new skills, leveraging PEMs for deficiency unlearning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a PEMs operation approach, namely Extraction-before-Subtraction (Ext-Sub), to enhance the truthfulness and detoxification of LLMs through the integration of ``expert'' PEM and ``anti-expert'' PEM. Remarkably, even anti-expert PEM possess valuable capabilities due to their proficiency in generating fabricated content, which necessitates language modeling and logical narrative competence. Rather than merely negating the parameters, our approach involves extracting and eliminating solely the deficiency capability within anti-expert PEM while preserving the general capabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of truthfulness and detoxification, we conduct extensive experiments on LLMs, encompassing additional abilities such as language modeling and mathematical reasoning. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively improves truthfulness and detoxification, while largely preserving the fundamental abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2024; The first two authors contributed equally to this paper</p></details> |

In response to this critical need, we introduce a novel approach called Attack-and-Reset for Unlearning (ARU). This algorithm leverages meticulously crafted adversarial noise to generate a parameter mask, effectively resetting certain parameters and rendering them unlearnable. ARU outperforms current state-of-the-art results on two facial machine-unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC. In particular, we present the steps involved in attacking and masking that strategically filter and re-initialize network parameters biased towards the forget set. Our work represents a significant advancement in rendering data unexploitable to deep learning models through parameter re-initialization, achieved by harnessing adversarial noise to craft a mask.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Unlearn: Instance-wise Unlearning for Pre-trained Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11578v3)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the recent advent of regulations for data protection (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation), there has been increasing demand in deleting information learned from sensitive data in pre-trained models without retraining from scratch. The inherent vulnerability of neural networks towards adversarial attacks and unfairness also calls for a robust method to remove or correct information in an instance-wise fashion, while retaining the predictive performance across remaining data. To this end, we consider instance-wise unlearning, of which the goal is to delete information on a set of instances from a pre-trained model, by either misclassifying each instance away from its original prediction or relabeling the instance to a different label. We also propose two methods that reduce forgetting on the remaining data: 1) utilizing adversarial examples to overcome forgetting at the representation-level and 2) leveraging weight importance metrics to pinpoint network parameters guilty of propagating unwanted information. Both methods only require the pre-trained model and data instances to forget, allowing painless application to real-life settings where the entire training set is unavailable. Through extensive experimentation on various image classification benchmarks, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning given instances in both single-task and continual unlearning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2024 camera ready version</p></details> |

Exposing Vulnerabilities in Machine Unlearning Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08230v2)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The right to be forgotten requires the removal or "unlearning" of a user's data from machine learning models. However, in the context of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), retraining a model from scratch to fulfill the unlearning request is impractical due to the lack of training data on the service provider's side (the server). Furthermore, approximate unlearning further embraces a complex trade-off between utility (model performance) and privacy (unlearning performance). In this paper, we try to explore the potential threats posed by unlearning services in MLaaS, specifically over-unlearning, where more information is unlearned than expected. We propose two strategies that leverage over-unlearning to measure the impact on the trade-off balancing, under black-box access settings, in which the existing machine unlearning attacks are not applicable. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, across various model architectures and representative unlearning approaches. Results indicate significant potential for both strategies to undermine model efficacy in unlearning scenarios. This study uncovers an underexplored gap between unlearning and contemporary MLaaS, highlighting the need for careful considerations in balancing data unlearning, model utility, and security.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2024, San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |

Unlearning, or tuning models to forget information present in their training data, provides us with a way to protect private data after training. Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place. To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning. We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning. We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy. Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms. Importantly, none of the baselines we consider show effective unlearning motivating continued efforts to develop approaches for unlearning that effectively tune models so that they truly behave as if they were never trained on the forget data at all.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://locuslab.github.io/tofu/</p></details> |

For this, data deletion needs to be deep and permanent, and should be removed from machine learning models. Researchers have proposed machine unlearning algorithms which aim to erase specific data from trained models more efficiently. However, these methods modify how data is fed into the model and how training is done, which may subsequently compromise AI ethics from the fairness perspective. To help software engineers make responsible decisions when adopting these unlearning methods, we present the first study on machine unlearning methods to reveal their fairness implications. We designed and conducted experiments on two typical machine unlearning methods (SISA and AmnesiacML) along with a retraining method (ORTR) as baseline using three fairness datasets under three different deletion strategies. Experimental results show that under non-uniform data deletion, SISA leads to better fairness compared with ORTR and AmnesiacML, while initial training and uniform data deletion do not necessarily affect the fairness of all three methods. These findings have exposed an important research problem in software engineering, and can help practitioners better understand the potential trade-offs on fairness when considering solutions for RTBF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI Spring Symposium on AI Trustworthiness Assessment 2023.

To avoid the cost of expensive data acquisition, researchers use the abundant data available on the internet. This raises significant privacy concerns on the potential misuse of personal data for model training without authorisation. Recent works such as CUDA propose solutions to this problem by adding class-wise blurs to make datasets unlearnable, i.e a model can never use the acquired dataset for learning. However these methods often reduce the quality of the data making it useless for practical applications. We introduce PosCUDA, a position based convolution for creating unlearnable audio datasets. PosCUDA uses class-wise convolutions on small patches of audio. The location of the patches are based on a private key for each class, hence the model learns the relations between positional blurs and labels, while failing to generalize. We empirically show that PosCUDA can achieve unlearnability while maintaining the quality of the original audio datasets. Our proposed method is also robust to different audio feature representations such as MFCC, raw audio and different architectures such as transformers, convolutional networks etc.</p></details> |  |

Class incremental learning (CIL) is employed for the gradual acquisition of knowledge about new categories while preserving information about previously learned ones in such dynamic environments. It might also be necessary to also eliminate the influence of related categories on the model to adapt to reclassification. We thus introduce class-level machine unlearning (MU) within CIL. Typically, MU methods tend to be time-consuming and can potentially harm the model's performance. A continuous stream of unlearning requests could lead to catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a non-destructive eCIL-MU framework based on embedding techniques to map data into vectors and then be stored in vector databases. Our approach exploits the overlap between CIL and MU tasks for acceleration. Experiments demonstrate the capability of achieving unlearning effectiveness and orders of magnitude (upto $\sim 278\times$) of acceleration.</p></details> |  |

Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Various regulations in different countries, including the GDPR grant individuals to have personal data erased, known as 'the right to be forgotten' or 'the right to erasure'. However, there has been less research on effectively and practically deleting the requested personal data from the training set while not jeopardizing the overall machine learning performance. In this work, we propose a fast and novel machine unlearning paradigm at the layer level called layer attack unlearning, which is highly accurate and fast compared to existing machine unlearning algorithms. We introduce the Partial-PGD algorithm to locate the samples to forget efficiently. In addition, we only use the last layer of the model inspired by the Forward-Forward algorithm for unlearning process. Lastly, we use Knowledge Distillation (KD) to reliably learn the decision boundaries from the teacher using soft label information to improve accuracy performance. We conducted extensive experiments with SOTA machine unlearning models and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for accuracy and end-to-end unlearning performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, various studies have presented machine unlearning algorithms and evaluated their methods on several datasets. However, most of the current machine unlearning algorithms have been evaluated solely on traditional computer vision datasets such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, and SVHN. Furthermore, previous studies generally evaluate the unlearning methods in the class-unlearning setup. Most previous work first trains the classification models and then evaluates the machine unlearning performance of machine unlearning algorithms by forgetting selected image classes (categories) in the experiments. Unfortunately, these class-unlearning settings might not generalize to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a machine unlearning setting that aims to unlearn specific instance that contains personal privacy (identity) while maintaining the original task of a given model. Specifically, we propose two machine unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC, that are greatly useful to evaluate the performance and robustness of a machine unlearning algorithm. In our benchmark datasets, the original model performs facial feature recognition tasks: face age estimation (multi-class classification) and facial attribute classification (binary class classification), where a class does not depend on any single target subject (personal identity), which can be a realistic setting. Moreover, we also report the performance of the state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods on our proposed benchmark datasets.

In response, ``machine unlearning'' proposes the selective removal of unwanted data without the need for retraining from scratch. While the Neural-Tangent-Kernel-based (NTK-based) unlearning method excels in performance, it suffers from significant computational complexity, especially for large-scale models and datasets. Our work introduces ``Fast-NTK,'' a novel NTK-based unlearning algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity by incorporating parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as fine-tuning batch normalization layers in a CNN or visual prompts in a vision transformer. Our experimental results demonstrate scalability to much larger neural networks and datasets (e.g., 88M parameters; 5k images), surpassing the limitations of previous full-model NTK-based approaches designed for smaller cases (e.g., 8M parameters; 500 images). Notably, our approach maintains a performance comparable to the traditional method of retraining on the retain set alone. Fast-NTK can thus enable for practical and scalable NTK-based unlearning in deep neural networks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

This urgency is particularly underscored by instances in which generative models generate outputs that encompass objectionable, offensive, or potentially injurious content. In response, machine unlearning has emerged to selectively forget specific knowledge or remove the influence of undesirable data subsets from pre-trained models. However, modern machine unlearning approaches typically assume access to model parameters and architectural details during unlearning, which is not always feasible. In multitude of downstream tasks, these models function as black-box systems, with inaccessible pre-trained parameters, architectures, and training data. In such scenarios, the possibility of filtering undesired outputs becomes a practical alternative. The primary goal of this study is twofold: first, to elucidate the relationship between filtering and unlearning processes, and second, to formulate a methodology aimed at mitigating the display of undesirable outputs generated from models characterized as black-box systems. Theoretical analysis in this study demonstrates that, in the context of black-box models, filtering can be seen as a form of weak unlearning. Our proposed \textbf{\textit{Feature Aware Similarity Thresholding(FAST)}} method effectively suppresses undesired outputs by systematically encoding the representation of unwanted features in the latent space.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Unlearning in Session-Based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14447v1)** | 2023-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation predicts users' future interests from previous interactions in a session. Despite the memorizing of historical samples, the request of unlearning, i.e., to remove the effect of certain training samples, also occurs for reasons such as user privacy or model fidelity. However, existing studies on unlearning are not tailored for the session-based recommendation. On the one hand, these approaches cannot achieve satisfying unlearning effects due to the collaborative correlations and sequential connections between the unlearning item and the remaining items in the session. On the other hand, seldom work has conducted the research to verify the unlearning effectiveness in the session-based recommendation scenario. In this paper, we propose SRU, a session-based recommendation unlearning framework, which enables high unlearning efficiency, accurate recommendation performance, and improved unlearning effectiveness in session-based recommendation. Specifically, we first partition the training sessions into separate sub-models according to the similarity across the sessions, then we utilize an attention-based aggregation layer to fuse the hidden states according to the correlations between the session and the centroid of the data in the sub-model. To improve the unlearning effectiveness, we further propose three extra data deletion strategies, including collaborative extra deletion (CED), neighbor extra deletion (NED), and random extra deletion (RED). Besides, we propose an evaluation metric that measures whether the unlearning sample can be inferred after the data deletion to verify the unlearning effectiveness. We implement SRU with three representative session-based recommendation models and conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Most of the existing works focus on unlearning from standard statistical learning models that have a single variable and their unlearning steps hinge on the direct Hessian-based conventional Newton update. We develop a new $(\epsilon,\delta)$-certified machine unlearning algorithm for minimax models. It proposes a minimax unlearning step consisting of a total-Hessian-based complete Newton update and the Gaussian mechanism borrowed from differential privacy. To obtain the unlearning certification, our method injects calibrated Gaussian noises by carefully analyzing the "sensitivity" of the minimax unlearning step (i.e., the closeness between the minimax unlearning variables and the retraining-from-scratch variables). We derive the generalization rates in terms of population strong and weak primal-dual risk for three different cases of loss functions, i.e., (strongly-)convex-(strongly-)concave losses. We also provide the deletion capacity to guarantee that a desired population risk can be maintained as long as the number of deleted samples does not exceed the derived amount. With training samples $n$ and model dimension $d$, it yields the order $\mathcal O(n/d^{1/4})$, which shows a strict gap over the baseline method of differentially private minimax learning that has $\mathcal O(n/d^{1/2})$. In addition, our rates of generalization and deletion capacity match the state-of-the-art rates derived previously for standard statistical learning models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |

Unlearnable examples have been proposed to avoid leaking personal information on the Internet by degrading generalization abilities of deep learning models. However, our study reveals that unlearnable examples are easily detectable. We provide theoretical results on linear separability of certain unlearnable poisoned dataset and simple network based detection methods that can identify all existing unlearnable examples, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. Detectability of unlearnable examples with simple networks motivates us to design a novel defense method. We propose using stronger data augmentations coupled with adversarial noises generated by simple networks, to degrade the detectability and thus provide effective defense against unlearnable examples with a lower cost. Adversarial training with large budgets is a widely-used defense method on unlearnable examples. We establish quantitative criteria between the poison and adversarial budgets which determine the existence of robust unlearnable examples or the failure of the adversarial defense.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 |
| **[Fast Machine Unlearning Without Retraining Through Selective Synaptic Dampening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07707v2)** | 2023-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning, the ability for a machine learning model to forget, is becoming increasingly important to comply with data privacy regulations, as well as to remove harmful, manipulated, or outdated information. The key challenge lies in forgetting specific information while protecting model performance on the remaining data. While current state-of-the-art methods perform well, they typically require some level of retraining over the retained data, in order to protect or restore model performance. This adds computational overhead and mandates that the training data remain available and accessible, which may not be feasible. In contrast, other methods employ a retrain-free paradigm, however, these approaches are prohibitively computationally expensive and do not perform on par with their retrain-based counterparts. We present Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD), a novel two-step, post hoc, retrain-free approach to machine unlearning which is fast, performant, and does not require long-term storage of the training data. First, SSD uses the Fisher information matrix of the training and forgetting data to select parameters that are disproportionately important to the forget set. Second, SSD induces forgetting by dampening these parameters proportional to their relative importance to the forget set with respect to the wider training data. We evaluate our method against several existing unlearning methods in a range of experiments using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer. Results show that the performance of SSD is competitive with retrain-based post hoc methods, demonstrating the viability of retrain-free post hoc unlearning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main track paper at AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Machine Unlearning for Backdoor Attacks in Deep Learning System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10659v2)** | 2023-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the security issues of artificial intelligence have become increasingly prominent due to the rapid development of deep learning research and applications. Backdoor attack is an attack targeting the vulnerability of deep learning models, where hidden backdoors are activated by triggers embedded by the attacker, thereby outputting malicious predictions that may not align with the intended output for a given input. In this work, we propose a novel black-box backdoor attack based on machine unlearning. The attacker first augments the training set with carefully designed samples, including poison and mitigation data, to train a `benign' model. Then, the attacker posts unlearning requests for the mitigation samples to remove the impact of relevant data on the model, gradually activating the hidden backdoor. Since backdoors are implanted during the iterative unlearning process, it significantly increases the computational overhead of existing defense methods for backdoor detection or mitigation. To address this new security threat, we proposes two methods for detecting or mitigating such malicious unlearning requests. We conduct the experiment in both exact unlearning and approximate unlearning (i.e., SISA) settings. Experimental results indicate that: 1) our attack approach can successfully implant backdoor into the model, and sharding increases the difficult of attack; 2) our detection algorithms are effective in identifying the mitigation samples, while sharding reduces the effectiveness of our detection algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairSISA: Ensemble Post-Processing to Improve Fairness of Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07420v1)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) is a costly endeavour in terms of time and computational resources. The large amount of training data used during the unsupervised pre-training phase makes it difficult to verify all data and, unfortunately, undesirable data may be ingested during training. Re-training from scratch is impractical and has led to the creation of the 'unlearning' discipline where models are modified to "unlearn" undesirable information without retraining. However, any modification can alter the behaviour of LLMs, especially on key dimensions such as fairness. This is the first work that examines this interplay between unlearning and fairness for LLMs. In particular, we focus on a popular unlearning framework known as SISA [Bourtoule et al., 2021], which creates an ensemble of models trained on disjoint shards. We evaluate the performance-fairness trade-off for SISA, and empirically demsontrate that SISA can indeed reduce fairness in LLMs. To remedy this, we propose post-processing bias mitigation techniques for ensemble models produced by SISA. We adapt the post-processing fairness improvement technique from [Hardt et al., 2016] to design three methods that can handle model ensembles, and prove that one of the methods is an optimal fair predictor for ensemble of models. Through experimental results, we demonstrate the efficacy of our post-processing framework called 'FairSISA'.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research (SoLaR)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs: Tasks, Methods, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15766v2)** | 2023-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have spurred a new research paradigm in natural language processing. Despite their excellent capability in knowledge-based question answering and reasoning, their potential to retain faulty or even harmful knowledge poses risks of malicious application. The challenge of mitigating this issue and transforming these models into purer assistants is crucial for their widespread applicability. Unfortunately, Retraining LLMs repeatedly to eliminate undesirable knowledge is impractical due to their immense parameters. Knowledge unlearning, derived from analogous studies on machine unlearning, presents a promising avenue to address this concern and is notably advantageous in the context of LLMs. It allows for the removal of harmful knowledge in an efficient manner, without affecting unrelated knowledge in the model. To this end, we provide a survey of knowledge unlearning in the era of LLMs. Firstly, we formally define the knowledge unlearning problem and distinguish it from related works. Subsequently, we categorize existing knowledge unlearning methods into three classes: those based on parameter optimization, parameter merging, and in-context learning, and introduce details of these unlearning methods. We further present evaluation datasets used in existing methods, and finally conclude this survey by presenting the ongoing challenges and future directions.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Learn to Unlearn for Deep Neural Networks: Minimizing Unlearning Interference with Gradient Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04095v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent data-privacy laws have sparked interest in machine unlearning, which involves removing the effect of specific training samples from a learnt model as if they were never present in the original training dataset. The challenge of machine unlearning is to discard information about the ``forget'' data in the learnt model without altering the knowledge about the remaining dataset and to do so more efficiently than the naive retraining approach. To achieve this, we adopt a projected-gradient based learning method, named as Projected-Gradient Unlearning (PGU), in which the model takes steps in the orthogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed unimportant for the retaining dataset, so as to its knowledge is preserved. By utilizing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update the model weights, our method can efficiently scale to any model and dataset size. We provide empirically evidence to demonstrate that our unlearning method can produce models that behave similar to models retrained from scratch across various metrics even when the training dataset is no longer accessible. Our code is available at https://github.com/hnanhtuan/projected_gradient_unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Strategic Data Revocation in Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01235v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By allowing users to erase their data's impact on federated learning models, federated unlearning protects users' right to be forgotten and data privacy. Despite a burgeoning body of research on federated unlearning's technical feasibility, there is a paucity of literature investigating the considerations behind users' requests for data revocation. This paper proposes a non-cooperative game framework to study users' data revocation strategies in federated unlearning. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium. However, users' best response strategies are coupled via model performance and unlearning costs, which makes the equilibrium computation challenging. We obtain the Nash equilibrium by establishing its equivalence with a much simpler auxiliary optimization problem. We also summarize users' multi-dimensional attributes into a single-dimensional metric and derive the closed-form characterization of an equilibrium, when users' unlearning costs are negligible. Moreover, we compare the cases of allowing and forbidding partial data revocation in federated unlearning. Interestingly, the results reveal that allowing partial revocation does not necessarily increase users' data contributions or payoffs due to the game structure. Additionally, we demonstrate that positive externalities may exist between users' data revocation decisions when users incur unlearning costs, while this is not the case when their unlearning costs are negligible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2024</p></details> |
| **[DUCK: Distance-based Unlearning via Centroid Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02052v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning is rising as a new field, driven by the pressing necessity of ensuring privacy in modern artificial intelligence models. This technique primarily aims to eradicate any residual influence of a specific subset of data from the knowledge acquired by a neural model during its training. This work introduces a novel unlearning algorithm, denoted as Distance-based Unlearning via Centroid Kinematics (DUCK), which employs metric learning to guide the removal of samples matching the nearest incorrect centroid in the embedding space. Evaluation of the algorithm's performance is conducted across various benchmark datasets in two distinct scenarios, class removal, and homogeneous sampling removal, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. We introduce a novel metric, called Adaptive Unlearning Score (AUS), encompassing not only the efficacy of the unlearning process in forgetting target data but also quantifying the performance loss relative to the original model. Moreover, we propose a novel membership inference attack to assess the algorithm's capacity to erase previously acquired knowledge, designed to be adaptable to future methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Unlearning: Fast and Efficient Training-free Approach to Controlled Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00761v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning has emerged as a prominent and challenging area of interest, driven in large part by the rising regulatory demands for industries to delete user data upon request and the heightened awareness of privacy. Existing approaches either retrain models from scratch or use several finetuning steps for every deletion request, often constrained by computational resource limitations and restricted access to the original training data. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate an entire class or a group of classes from the learned model. To that end, our algorithm first estimates the Retain Space and the Forget Space, representing the feature or activation spaces for samples from classes to be retained and unlearned, respectively. To obtain these spaces, we propose a novel singular value decomposition-based technique that requires layer wise collection of network activations from a few forward passes through the network. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space for unlearning. Finally, we project the model weights in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space to obtain the unlearned model. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\sim$1.5% drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under 1% accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing 7.8% improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\sim$6x more computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12502v2)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To protect users' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated unlearning aims at eliminating the impact of leaving users' data on the global learned model. The current research in federated unlearning mainly concentrated on developing effective and efficient unlearning techniques. However, the issue of incentivizing valuable users to remain engaged and preventing their data from being unlearned is still under-explored, yet important to the unlearned model performance. This paper focuses on the incentive issue and develops an incentive mechanism for federated learning and unlearning. We first characterize the leaving users' impact on the global model accuracy and the required communication rounds for unlearning. Building on these results, we propose a four-stage game to capture the interaction and information updates during the learning and unlearning process. A key contribution is to summarize users' multi-dimensional private information into one-dimensional metrics to guide the incentive design. We further investigate whether allowing federated unlearning is beneficial to the server and users, compared to a scenario without unlearning. Interestingly, users usually have a larger total payoff in the scenario with higher costs, due to the server's excess incentives under information asymmetry. The numerical results demonstrate the necessity of unlearning incentives for retaining valuable leaving users, and also show that our proposed mechanisms decrease the server's cost by up to 53.91\% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Corrupting Convolution-based Unlearnable Datasets with Pixel-based Image Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18403v1)** | 2023-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable datasets lead to a drastic drop in the generalization performance of models trained on them by introducing elaborate and imperceptible perturbations into clean training sets. Many existing defenses, e.g., JPEG compression and adversarial training, effectively counter UDs based on norm-constrained additive noise. However, a fire-new type of convolution-based UDs have been proposed and render existing defenses all ineffective, presenting a greater challenge to defenders. To address this, we express the convolution-based unlearnable sample as the result of multiplying a matrix by a clean sample in a simplified scenario, and formalize the intra-class matrix inconsistency as $\Theta_{imi}$, inter-class matrix consistency as $\Theta_{imc}$ to investigate the working mechanism of the convolution-based UDs. We conjecture that increasing both of these metrics will mitigate the unlearnability effect. Through validation experiments that commendably support our hypothesis, we further design a random matrix to boost both $\Theta_{imi}$ and $\Theta_{imc}$, achieving a notable degree of defense effect. Hence, by building upon and extending these facts, we first propose a brand-new image COrruption that employs randomly multiplicative transformation via INterpolation operation to successfully defend against convolution-based UDs. Our approach leverages global pixel random interpolations, effectively suppressing the impact of multiplicative noise in convolution-based UDs. Additionally, we have also designed two new forms of convolution-based UDs, and find that our defense is the most effective against them.</p></details> |  |
