| **[Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09897v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the issue of incompleteness within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Traditional KGC research primarily centers on triple classification and link prediction. Nevertheless, we contend that these tasks do not align well with real-world scenarios and merely serve as surrogate benchmarks. In this paper, we investigate three crucial processes relevant to real-world construction scenarios: (a) the verification process, which arises from the necessity and limitations of human verifiers; (b) the mining process, which identifies the most promising candidates for verification; and (c) the training process, which harnesses verified data for subsequent utilization; in order to achieve a transition toward more realistic challenges. By integrating these three processes, we introduce the Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC) task, which simulates the gradual completion of KGs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to expedite PKGC processing, we propose two acceleration modules: Optimized Top-$k$ algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter. These modules significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining procedure. Our experiments demonstrate that performance in link prediction does not accurately reflect performance in PKGC. A more in-depth analysis reveals the key factors influencing the results and provides potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[HyperMono: A Monotonicity-aware Approach to Hyper-Relational Knowledge Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09848v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[MyGO: Discrete Modality Information as Fine-Grained Tokens for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09468v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG) store structured world knowledge containing rich multi-modal descriptive information. To overcome their inherent incompleteness, multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given MMKGs, leveraging both structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities. Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models and employ a fusion module to integrate multi-modal features with triple prediction. However, this often results in a coarse handling of multi-modal data, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their interactions. To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to process, fuse, and augment the fine-grained modality information from MMKGs. MyGO tokenizes multi-modal raw data as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder. To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations. Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 20 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.

| **[Making Large Language Models Perform Better in Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06671v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing triples in the KGs with LLMs. However, research about LLM-based KGC fails to sufficiently harness LLMs' inference proficiencies, overlooking critical structural information integral to KGs. In this paper, we explore methods to incorporate structural information into the LLMs, with the overarching goal of facilitating structure-aware reasoning. We first discuss on the existing LLM paradigms like in-context learning and instruction tuning, proposing basic structural information injection approaches. Then we propose a Knowledge Prefix Adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. The KoPA uses a structural pre-training phase to comprehend the intricate entities and relations within KGs, representing them as structural embeddings. Then KoPA communicates such cross-modal structural information understanding to the LLMs through a knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens positioned as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide incisive analysis concerning how the introduction of cross-modal structural information would be better for LLM's factual knowledge reasoning ability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/KoPA .</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Harnessing the Power of Large Language Model for Uncertainty Aware Graph Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00589v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling graph data is one of the most difficult tasks. Traditional techniques, such as those based on geometry and matrix factorization, rely on assumptions about the data relations that become inadequate when handling large and complex graph data. On the other hand, deep learning approaches demonstrate promising results in handling large graph data, but they often fall short of providing interpretable explanations. To equip the graph processing with both high accuracy and explainability, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses the power of a large language model (LLM), enhanced by an uncertainty-aware module to provide a confidence score on the generated answer. We experiment with our approach on two graph processing tasks: few-shot knowledge graph completion and graph classification. Our results demonstrate that through parameter efficient fine-tuning, the LLM surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by a substantial margin across ten diverse benchmark datasets. Moreover, to address the challenge of explainability, we propose an uncertainty estimation based on perturbation, along with a calibration scheme to quantify the confidence scores of the generated answers. Our confidence measure achieves an AUC of 0.8 or higher on seven out of the ten datasets in predicting the correctness of the answer generated by LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Becau...</summary><p>Because my organization does not allow members to privately upload papers to arXiv, I am requesting a withdrawal of my submission</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Relational Learning for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06220v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational learning is an essential task in the domain of knowledge representation, particularly in knowledge graph completion (KGC).While relational learning in traditional single-modal settings has been extensively studied, exploring it within a multimodal KGC context presents distinct challenges and opportunities. One of the major challenges is inference on newly discovered relations without any associated training data. This zero-shot relational learning scenario poses unique requirements for multimodal KGC, i.e., utilizing multimodality to facilitate relational learning. However, existing works fail to support the leverage of multimodal information and leave the problem unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, consisting of three components, i.e., multimodal learner, structure consolidator, and relation embedding generator, to integrate diverse multimodal information and knowledge graph structures to facilitate the zero-shot relational learning. Evaluation results on two multimodal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KGExplainer: Towards Exploring Connected Subgraph Explanations for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03893v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to alleviate the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs), which is a critical task for various applications, such as recommendations on the web. Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables.

| **[IME: Integrating Multi-curvature Shared and Specific Embedding for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19881v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for a precise capture of the evolution of knowledge and reflecting the dynamic nature of the real world. Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures, with various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space or neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining their capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature spaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Subsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property and space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning of commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial gap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the space-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME proposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively retain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity, difference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.</p></details> |  |
| **[KC-GenRe: A Knowledge-constrained Generative Re-ranking Method Based on Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17532v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is to predict missing facts among entities. Previous methods for KGC re-ranking are mostly built on non-generative language models to obtain the probability of each candidate. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance on several tasks such as information extraction and dialog systems. Leveraging them for KGC re-ranking is beneficial for leveraging the extensive pre-trained knowledge and powerful generative capabilities. However, it may encounter new problems when accomplishing the task, namely mismatch, misordering and omission. To this end, we introduce KC-GenRe, a knowledge-constrained generative re-ranking method based on LLMs for KGC. To overcome the mismatch issue, we formulate the KGC re-ranking task as a candidate identifier sorting generation problem implemented by generative LLMs. To tackle the misordering issue, we develop a knowledge-guided interactive training method that enhances the identification and ranking of candidates. To address the omission issue, we design a knowledge-augmented constrained inference method that enables contextual prompting and controlled generation, so as to obtain valid rankings. Experimental results show that KG-GenRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, with gains of up to 6.7% and 7.7% in the MRR and Hits@1 metric compared to previous methods, and 9.0% and 11.1% compared to that without re-ranking. Extensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of components in KG-GenRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with GNNs and Rules: An Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07942v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04521v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs. The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution. Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution. Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions. Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization. The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Power of Noise: Toward a Unified Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Representation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06832v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Multi-modal Pre-training highlights the necessity for a robust Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework. This framework is crucial for integrating structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale, aiming to alleviate issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, to evaluate models' ability to accurately embed entities within MMKGs, we focus on two widely researched tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking for the robust integration of multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets (three for MKGC and seven for MEMA), demonstrating its robustness and versatility. Besides, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/zjukg/SNAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 10 pages, 6 Tables, 2 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/zjukg/SNAG</p></details> |
| **[Hyper-CL: Conditioning Sentence Representations with Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09490v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the introduction of contrastive learning frameworks in sentence representation learning has significantly contributed to advancements in the field, it still remains unclear whether state-of-the-art sentence embeddings can capture the fine-grained semantics of sentences, particularly when conditioned on specific perspectives. In this paper, we introduce Hyper-CL, an efficient methodology that integrates hypernetworks with contrastive learning to compute conditioned sentence representations. In our proposed approach, the hypernetwork is responsible for transforming pre-computed condition embeddings into corresponding projection layers. This enables the same sentence embeddings to be projected differently according to various conditions. Evaluation on two representative conditioning benchmarks, namely conditional semantic text similarity and knowledge graph completion, demonstrates that Hyper-CL is effective in flexibly conditioning sentence representations, showcasing its computational efficiency at the same time. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the inner workings of our approach, leading to a better interpretation of its mechanisms.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Counterfactual Reasoning with Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06936v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) were originally developed to infer true but missing facts in incomplete knowledge repositories. In this paper, we link knowledge graph completion and counterfactual reasoning via our new task CFKGR. We model the original world state as a knowledge graph, hypothetical scenarios as edges added to the graph, and plausible changes to the graph as inferences from logical rules. We create corresponding benchmark datasets, which contain diverse hypothetical scenarios with plausible changes to the original knowledge graph and facts that should be retained. We develop COULDD, a general method for adapting existing knowledge graph embeddings given a hypothetical premise, and evaluate it on our benchmark. Our results indicate that KGEs learn patterns in the graph without explicit training. We further observe that KGEs adapted with COULDD solidly detect plausible counterfactual changes to the graph that follow these patterns. An evaluation on human-annotated data reveals that KGEs adapted with COULDD are mostly unable to recognize changes to the graph that do not follow learned inference rules. In contrast, ChatGPT mostly outperforms KGEs in detecting plausible changes to the graph but has poor knowledge retention. In summary, CFKGR connects two previously distinct areas, namely KG completion and counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[HDReason: Algorithm-Hardware Codesign for Hyperdimensional Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05763v1)** | 2024-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, a plethora of hardware accelerators have been put forth for graph learning applications such as vertex classification and graph classification. However, previous works have paid little attention to Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), a task that is well-known for its significantly higher algorithm complexity. The state-of-the-art KGC solutions based on graph convolution neural network (GCN) involve extensive vertex/relation embedding updates and complicated score functions, which are inherently cumbersome for acceleration. As a result, existing accelerator designs are no longer optimal, and a novel algorithm-hardware co-design for KG reasoning is needed. Recently, brain-inspired HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution for lightweight machine learning, particularly for graph learning applications. In this paper, we leverage HDC for an intrinsically more efficient and acceleration-friendly KGC algorithm. We also co-design an acceleration framework named HDReason targeting FPGA platforms. On the algorithm level, HDReason achieves a balance between high reasoning accuracy, strong model interpretability, and less computation complexity. In terms of architecture, HDReason offers reconfigurability, high training throughput, and low energy consumption. When compared with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, the proposed accelerator achieves an average 10.6x speedup and 65x energy efficiency improvement. When conducting cross-models and cross-platforms comparison, HDReason yields an average 4.2x higher performance and 3.4x better energy efficiency with similar accuracy versus the state-of-the-art FPGA-based GCN training platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-perspective Improvement of Knowledge Graph Completion with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01972v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a widely used method to tackle incompleteness in knowledge graphs (KGs) by making predictions for missing links. Description-based KGC leverages pre-trained language models to learn entity and relation representations with their names or descriptions, which shows promising results. However, the performance of description-based KGC is still limited by the quality of text and the incomplete structure, as it lacks sufficient entity descriptions and relies solely on relation names, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose MPIKGC, a general framework to compensate for the deficiency of contextualized knowledge and improve KGC by querying large language models (LLMs) from various perspectives, which involves leveraging the reasoning, explanation, and summarization capabilities of LLMs to expand entity descriptions, understand relations, and extract structures, respectively. We conducted extensive evaluation of the effectiveness and improvement of our framework based on four description-based KGC models and four datasets, for both link prediction and triplet classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[Pre-trained Language Model with Prompts for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07912v2)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge graph completion (TKGC) is a crucial task that involves reasoning at known timestamps to complete the missing part of facts and has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus on learning representations based on graph neural networks while inaccurately extracting information from timestamps and insufficiently utilizing the implied information in relations. To address these problems, we propose a novel TKGC model, namely Pre-trained Language Model with Prompts for TKGC (PPT). We convert a series of sampled quadruples into pre-trained language model inputs and convert intervals between timestamps into different prompts to make coherent sentences with implicit semantic information. We train our model with a masking strategy to convert TKGC task into a masked token prediction task, which can leverage the semantic information in pre-trained language models. Experiments on three benchmark datasets and extensive analysis demonstrate that our model has great competitiveness compared to other models with four metrics. Our model can effectively incorporate information from temporal knowledge graphs into the language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2023</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion with Time-sensitive Relations in Hypercomplex Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02355v1)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) aims to fill in missing facts within a given temporal knowledge graph at a specific time. Existing methods, operating in real or complex spaces, have demonstrated promising performance in this task. This paper advances beyond conventional approaches by introducing more expressive quaternion representations for TKGC within hypercomplex space. Unlike existing quaternion-based methods, our study focuses on capturing time-sensitive relations rather than time-aware entities. Specifically, we model time-sensitive relations through time-aware rotation and periodic time translation, effectively capturing complex temporal variability. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate our method's capability to model symmetric, asymmetric, inverse, compositional, and evolutionary relation patterns. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets validate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the field of TKGC.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we carefully review over 300 articles, focusing on KG-aware research in two principal aspects: KG-driven Multi-Modal (KG4MM) learning, where KGs support multi-modal tasks, and Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MM4KG), which extends KG studies into the MMKG realm. We begin by defining KGs and MMKGs, then explore their construction progress. Our review includes two primary task categories: KG-aware multi-modal learning tasks, such as Image Classification and Visual Question Answering, and intrinsic MMKG tasks like Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion and Entity Alignment, highlighting specific research trajectories. For most of these tasks, we provide definitions, evaluation benchmarks, and additionally outline essential insights for conducting relevant research. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify emerging trends, such as progress in Large Language Modeling and Multi-modal Pre-training strategies. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for researchers already involved in or considering delving into KG and multi-modal learning research, offering insights into the evolving landscape of MMKG research and supporting future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 41 pages (Main Text), 55 pages (Total), 11 Tables, 13 Figures, 619 citations; Paper list is available at https://github.com/zjukg/KG-MM-Survey</p></details> |
| **[Rendering Graphs for Graph Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02130v3)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for various tasks with graph structures, such as robotic planning, knowledge graph completion, and common-sense reasoning. Though LLMs can comprehend graph information in a textual format, they overlook the rich visual modality, which is an intuitive way for humans to comprehend structural information and conduct graph reasoning. The potential benefits and capabilities of representing graph structures as visual images (i.e., visual graph) is still unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step in incorporating visual information into graph reasoning tasks and propose a new benchmark GITQA, where each sample is a tuple (graph, image, textual description). We conduct extensive experiments on the GITQA benchmark using state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. Results on graph reasoning tasks show that combining textual and visual information together performs better than using one modality alone. Moreover, the LLaVA-7B/13B models finetuned on the training set (referred to as GITA), achieve higher accuracy than the closed-source model GPT-4(V). We also study the effects of augmentations in graph reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To surmount these challenges, we introduce the Contextualization Distillation strategy, a versatile plug-in-and-play approach compatible with both discriminative and generative KGC frameworks. Our method begins by instructing large language models (LLMs) to transform compact, structural triplets into context-rich segments. Subsequently, we introduce two tailored auxiliary tasks, reconstruction and contextualization, allowing smaller KGC models to assimilate insights from these enriched triplets. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and KGC techniques highlight the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, revealing consistent performance enhancements irrespective of underlying pipelines or architectures. Moreover, our analysis makes our method more explainable and provides insight into generating path selection, as well as the choosing of suitable distillation tasks.

| **[KICGPT: Large Language Model with Knowledge in Context for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02389v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is crucial for addressing knowledge graph incompleteness and supporting downstream applications. Many models have been proposed for KGC. They can be categorized into two main classes: triple-based and text-based approaches. Triple-based methods struggle with long-tail entities due to limited structural information and imbalanced entity distributions. Text-based methods alleviate this issue but require costly training for language models and specific finetuning for knowledge graphs, which limits their efficiency. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose KICGPT, a framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) and a triple-based KGC retriever. It alleviates the long-tail problem without incurring additional training overhead. KICGPT uses an in-context learning strategy called Knowledge Prompt, which encodes structural knowledge into demonstrations to guide the LLM. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KICGPT with smaller training overhead and no finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Imbalanced Modality Information for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15444v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict the missing triples in the multi-modal knowledge graphs by incorporating structural, visual, and textual information of entities into the discriminant models. The information from different modalities will work together to measure the triple plausibility. Existing MMKGC methods overlook the imbalance problem of modality information among entities, resulting in inadequate modal fusion and inefficient utilization of the raw modality information. To address the mentioned problems, we propose Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion and Modality Adversarial Training (AdaMF-MAT) to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information for MMKGC. AdaMF-MAT achieves multi-modal fusion with adaptive modality weights and further generates adversarial samples by modality-adversarial training to enhance the imbalanced modality information. Our approach is a co-design of the MMKGC model and training strategy which can outperform 19 recent MMKGC methods and achieve new state-of-the-art results on three public MMKGC benchmarks.

| **[VN Network: Embedding Newly Emerging Entities with Virtual Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14033v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding entities and relations into continuous vector spaces has attracted a surge of interest in recent years. Most embedding methods assume that all test entities are available during training, which makes it time-consuming to retrain embeddings for newly emerging entities. To address this issue, recent works apply the graph neural network on the existing neighbors of the unseen entities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Virtual Neighbor (VN) network, to address three key challenges. Firstly, to reduce the neighbor sparsity problem, we introduce the concept of the virtual neighbors inferred by rules. And we assign soft labels to these neighbors by solving a rule-constrained problem, rather than simply regarding them as unquestionably true. Secondly, many existing methods only use one-hop or two-hop neighbors for aggregation and ignore the distant information that may be helpful. Instead, we identify both logic and symmetric path rules to capture complex patterns. Finally, instead of one-time injection of rules, we employ an iterative learning scheme between the embedding method and virtual neighbor prediction to capture the interactions within. Experimental results on two knowledge graph completion tasks demonstrate that our VN network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, results on Subject/Object-R show that our proposed VN network is highly robust to the neighbor sparsity problem.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In this study, we explore utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) for knowledge graph completion. We consider triples in knowledge graphs as text sequences and introduce an innovative framework called Knowledge Graph LLM (KG-LLM) to model these triples. Our technique employs entity and relation descriptions of a triple as prompts and utilizes the response for predictions. Experiments on various benchmark knowledge graphs demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as triple classification and relation prediction. We also find that fine-tuning relatively smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-7B, ChatGLM-6B) outperforms recent ChatGPT and GPT-4.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This draft is further refined by incorporating key details and background information from a specially designed sports knowledge graph. This graph contains 5,893 entities, which are classified into three distinct conceptual categories, interconnected through four relationship types, and characterized by 27 unique attributes. In addition, we create a multi-stage learning model by combining convolutional neural networks and a transformer encoder. This model expresses entity-task interactions using convolutional neural networks and enriches entity representations in the query set with the transformer encoder. It also includes a processor to compute matching scores for incomplete triples, addressing few-shot knowledge graph completion problem. The efficiency of this approach has been confirmed through both subjective and objective evaluations of 50 selected test cases, demonstrating its capability in revolutionizing the creation of sports news.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on harnessing the advantages of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning in temporal knowledge graphs, presenting an easily transferable pipeline. In terms of graph modality, we underscore the LLMs' prowess in discerning the structural information of pivotal nodes within the historical chain. As for the generation mode of the LLMs utilized for inference, we conduct an exhaustive exploration into the variances induced by a range of inherent factors in LLMs, with particular attention to the challenges in comprehending reverse logic. We adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy to harmonize the LLMs with the task requirements, facilitating the learning of the key knowledge highlighted earlier. Comprehensive experiments are undertaken on several widely recognized datasets, revealing that our framework exceeds or parallels existing methods across numerous popular metrics. Additionally, we execute a substantial range of ablation experiments and draw comparisons with several advanced commercial LLMs, to investigate the crucial factors influencing LLMs' performance in structured temporal knowledge inference tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; typos corrected, references added</p></details> |

Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama-2-13B, we obtain the UrbanKGC agent, UrbanKGent-13B. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent-13B not only can significantly outperform 21 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10\% with approximately 20 times lower cost. We deploy UrbanKGent-13B to provide online services, which can construct an UrbanKG with thousands of times richer relationships using only one-fifth of the data compared with the existing benchmark. Our data, code, and opensource UrbanKGC agent are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/UrbanKGent.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Are We Wasting Time? A Fast, Accurate Performance Evaluation Framework for Knowledge Graph Link Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00053v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard evaluation protocol for measuring the quality of Knowledge Graph Completion methods - the task of inferring new links to be added to a graph - typically involves a step which ranks every entity of a Knowledge Graph to assess their fit as a head or tail of a candidate link to be added. In Knowledge Graphs on a larger scale, this task rapidly becomes prohibitively heavy. Previous approaches mitigate this problem by using random sampling of entities to assess the quality of links predicted or suggested by a method. However, we show that this approach has serious limitations since the ranking metrics produced do not properly reflect true outcomes. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of these effects along with the following findings. First, we empirically find and theoretically motivate why sampling uniformly at random vastly overestimates the ranking performance of a method. We show that this can be attributed to the effect of easy versus hard negative candidates. Second, we propose a framework that uses relational recommenders to guide the selection of candidates for evaluation. We provide both theoretical and empirical justification of our methodology, and find that simple and fast methods can work extremely well, and that they match advanced neural approaches. Even when a large portion of true candidates for a property are missed, the estimation barely deteriorates. With our proposed framework, we can reduce the time and computation needed similar to random sampling strategies while vastly improving the estimation; on ogbl-wikikg2, we show that accurate estimations of the full, filtered ranking can be obtained in 20 seconds instead of 30 minutes. We conclude that considerable computational effort can be saved by effective preprocessing and sampling methods and still reliably predict performance accurately of the true performance for the entire ranking procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Distillation Based on Masked Generation Feature Method for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12997v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, knowledge graph completion (KGC) models based on pre-trained language model (PLM) have shown promising results. However, the large number of parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However, traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7\% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

The efficacy of these models hinges on the quality of the textual data. This study explores whether enriched or more efficient textual descriptions can amplify model performance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in NLP tasks, attributed to their sophisticated text generation and conversational capabilities. LLMs assimilate linguistic patterns and integrate knowledge from their training data. Compared to traditional databases like Wikipedia, LLMs provide several advantages, facilitating broader information querying and content augmentation. We hypothesize that LLMs, without fine-tuning, can refine entity descriptions, serving as an auxiliary knowledge source. An in-depth analysis was conducted to verify this hypothesis. We found that (1) without fine-tuning, LLMs have the capability to further improve the quality of entity text descriptions. We validated this through experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets. (2) LLMs exhibit text generation hallucination issues and selectively output words with multiple meanings. This was mitigated by contextualizing prompts to constrain LLM outputs. (3) Larger model sizes do not necessarily guarantee better performance; even the 7B model can achieve optimized results in this comparative task. These findings underscore the untapped potential of large models in text-based KGC, which is a promising direction for further research in KGC.

Law enforcement agencies can effectively maintain social security and precisely combat criminal activities by analyzing the aforementioned data. In comparison to traditional data analysis methods, deep learning models, relying on the robust computational power in cloud centers, exhibit higher accuracy in extracting data features and inferring data. However, within the architecture of cloud centers, the transmission of data from end devices introduces significant latency, hindering real-time inference of data. Furthermore, low-latency edge computing architectures face limitations in direct deployment due to relatively weak computing and storage capacities of nodes. To address these challenges, a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture that utilizes knowledge graph embedding for data analysis. Subsequently, to filter out substandard data, a personnel data quality assessment method named PDQA is proposed. Lastly, we present a model pruning algorithm that significantly reduces the model size while maximizing performance, enabling lightweight deployment. In experiments, we compare the effects of 11 advanced models on completing the knowledge graph of public security personnel information. The results indicate that the RotatE model outperforms other models significantly in knowledge graph completion, with the pruned model size reduced by 70\%, and hits@10 reaching 86.97\%.}</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, Has been accepted by Wireless Network</p></details> |

However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three new metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a qualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link outperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

While training KGC models on multiple aligned KGs can improve performance, previous methods that rely on transferring raw data among KGs raise privacy concerns. To address this challenge, we propose a new federated learning framework that implicitly aggregates knowledge from multiple KGs without demanding raw data exchange and entity alignment. We treat each KG as a client that trains a local language model through textbased knowledge representation learning. A central server then aggregates the model weights from clients. As natural language provides a universal representation, the same knowledge thus has similar semantic representations across KGs. As such, the aggregated language model can leverage complementary knowledge from multilingual KGs without demanding raw user data sharing. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method substantially improves KGC on multilingual KGs, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art alignment-based models without requiring any labeled alignments or raw user data sharing. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Deep knowledge convolutional embedding models based on neural networks are currently popular methods for knowledge graph completion. However, most existing methods use external convolution kernels and traditional plain convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model ConvD for knowledge graph completion, which directly reshapes the relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels to improve the external convolution kernels of the traditional convolutional embedding model. The internal convolution kernels can effectively augment the feature interaction between the relation embeddings and entity embeddings, thus enhancing the model embedding performance. Moreover, we design a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism, which can assign different contribution weight coefficients to multiple relation convolution kernels for dynamic convolution to improve the expressiveness of the model further. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 11.30\% to 16.92\% across all model evaluation metrics. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of each component module of the ConvD model.</p></details> |  |

With the success of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT, they have been applied for text encoding for KGC. However, the current methods mostly prefer to fine-tune PLMs, leading to huge training costs and limited scalability to larger PLMs. In contrast, we propose to utilize prompts and perform KGC on a frozen PLM with only the prompts trained. Accordingly, we propose a new KGC method named PDKGC with two prompts -- a hard task prompt which is to adapt the KGC task to the PLM pre-training task of token prediction, and a disentangled structure prompt which learns disentangled graph representation so as to enable the PLM to combine more relevant structure knowledge with the text information. With the two prompts, PDKGC builds a textual predictor and a structural predictor, respectively, and their combination leads to more comprehensive entity prediction. Solid evaluation on two widely used KGC datasets has shown that PDKGC often outperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art, and its components are all effective.

However, when it comes to non-English languages, the quantity and quality of textual information are comparatively scarce. To address this issue, we introduce the novel task of automatic Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE) and perform a thorough investigation on bridging the gap in both the quantity and quality of textual information between English and non-English languages. More specifically, we: i) bring to light the problem of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of entity names and descriptions in Wikidata; ii) demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods, namely, Machine Translation (MT), Web Search (WS), and Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with this task; iii) present M-NTA, a novel unsupervised approach that combines MT, WS, and LLMs to generate high-quality textual information; and, iv) study the impact of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of non-English textual information in Entity Linking, Knowledge Graph Completion, and Question Answering.

However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommendation. Experimental results on six datasets show that Relphormer can obtain better performance compared with baselines.

In real-world scenarios, KGs are distributed across clients, complicating completion tasks due to privacy restrictions. Many frameworks have been proposed to address the issue of federated knowledge graph completion. However, the existing frameworks, including FedE, FedR, and FEKG, have certain limitations. = FedE poses a risk of information leakage, FedR's optimization efficacy diminishes when there is minimal overlap among relations, and FKGE suffers from computational costs and mode collapse issues. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, i.e., Federated Latent Embedding Sharing Tensor factorization (FLEST), which is a novel approach using federated tensor factorization for KG completion. FLEST decompose the embedding matrix and enables sharing of latent dictionary embeddings to lower privacy risks. Empirical results demonstrate FLEST's effectiveness and efficiency, offering a balanced solution between performance and privacy.

Due to the difficulty of manually enumerating all relationships between entities, automatically completing them is essential for KGs. Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a task that infers unseen relationships between entities in a KG. Traditional embedding-based KGC methods, such as RESCAL, TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, HousE, etc., infer missing links using only the knowledge from training data. In contrast, the recent Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based KGC utilizes knowledge obtained during pre-training. Therefore, PLM-based KGC can estimate missing links between entities by reusing memorized knowledge from pre-training without inference. This approach is problematic because building KGC models aims to infer unseen links between entities. However, conventional evaluations in KGC do not consider inference and memorization abilities separately. Thus, a PLM-based KGC method, which achieves high performance in current KGC evaluations, may be ineffective in practical applications. To address this issue, we analyze whether PLM-based KGC methods make inferences or merely access memorized knowledge. For this purpose, we propose a method for constructing synthetic datasets specified in this analysis and conclude that PLMs acquire the inference abilities required for KGC through pre-training, even though the performance improvements mostly come from textual information of entities and relations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However current benchmarks mostly follow the data distribution of the pre-training data of LLMs. Therefore, a natural question rises that do LLMs really understand the structured semantics of formal languages. In this paper, we investigate this problem on a special case, converse binary relation. We introduce a new benchmark ConvRe focusing on converse relations, which contains 17 relations and 1240 triples extracted from popular knowledge graph completion datasets. Our ConvRE features two tasks, Re2Text and Text2Re, which are formulated as multi-choice question answering to evaluate LLMs' ability to determine the matching between relations and associated text. For the evaluation protocol, apart from different prompting methods, we further introduce variants to the test text and few-shot example text. We conduct experiments on three popular LLM families and have observed various scaling trends. The results suggest that LLMs often resort to shortcut learning and still face challenges on our proposed benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2023</p></details> |

In recent, pre-trained language model (PLM) based methods that utilize both textual and structural information are emerging, but their performances lag behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) structure-based methods or some methods lose their inductive inference capabilities in the process of fusing structure embedding to text encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel method to effectively unify structure information and language semantics without losing the power of inductive reasoning. We adopt entity anchors and these anchors and textual description of KG elements are fed together into the PLM-based encoder to learn unified representations. In addition, the proposed method utilizes additional random negative samples which can be reused in the each mini-batch during contrastive learning to learn a generalized entity representations. We verify the effectiveness of the our proposed method through various experiments and analysis. The experimental results on standard benchmark widely used in link prediction task show that the proposed model outperforms existing the SOTA KGC models. Especially, our method show the largest performance improvement on FB15K-237, which is competitive to the SOTA of structure-based KGC methods.</p></details> |  |

In response, we explore ensembling as a way of combining the best of both approaches. We propose a novel method for learning query-dependent ensemble weights by using the distributions of scores assigned by individual models to all candidate entities.

Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) techniques aim to address this issue. However, traditional KGC methods are computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale KGs, necessitating the learning of dense node embeddings and computing pairwise distances. Generative transformer-based language models (e.g., T5 and recent KGT5) offer a promising solution as they can predict the tail nodes directly. In this study, we propose to include node neighborhoods as additional information to improve KGC methods based on language models. We examine the effects of this imputation and show that, on both inductive and transductive Wikidata subsets, our method outperforms KGT5 and conventional KGC approaches.

A new class of methods have been proposed to tackle this problem by aggregating path information. These methods have shown tremendous ability in the task of KGC. However they are plagued by efficiency issues. Though there are a few recent attempts to address this through learnable path pruning, they often sacrifice the performance to gain efficiency. In this work, we identify two intrinsic limitations of these methods that affect the efficiency and representation quality. To address the limitations, we introduce a new method, TAGNet, which is able to efficiently propagate information. This is achieved by only aggregating paths in a fixed window for each source-target pair. We demonstrate that the complexity of TAGNet is independent of the number of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAGNet can cut down on the number of propagated messages by as much as 90% while achieving competitive performance on multiple KG datasets.

Existing approaches also consider the neighborhood of the head entity. However, these methods tend to model the neighborhood using a flat structure and are only restricted to 1-hop neighbors. In this work, we propose a node neighborhood-enhanced framework for knowledge graph completion. It models the head entity neighborhood from multiple hops using graph neural networks to enrich the head node information. Moreover, we introduce an additional edge link prediction task to improve KGC. Evaluation on two public datasets shows that this framework is simple yet effective. The case study also shows that the model is able to predict explainable predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>DL4KG...</summary><p>DL4KG Workshop, ISWC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Negative Sampling with Adaptive Denoising Mixup for Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09781v1)** | 2023-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into a low-dimensional and dense vector space via contrasting the positive and negative triples. In the training process of KGEs, negative sampling is essential to find high-quality negative triples since KGs only contain positive triples. Most existing negative sampling methods assume that non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples. However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise. Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also be true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false negative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable denoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by refining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled unlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative triple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself. Secondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to synthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple. Experimental results on the knowledge graph completion task show that the proposed DeMix is superior to other negative sampling techniques, ensuring corresponding KGEs a faster convergence and better link prediction results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISWC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Time Interval Prediction in Text-Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16357v1)** | 2023-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods learn latent representations of entities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space. Although the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a large number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the time instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are often known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may also contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal information and textual descriptions are not taken into account during representation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information of the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal information to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual descriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities that have not been seen in training). We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph completion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously unseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts. Unlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across different time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the performance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval prediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple classification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[KERMIT: Knowledge Graph Completion of Enhanced Relation Modeling with Inverse Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14770v1)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion is a task that revolves around filling in missing triples based on the information available in a knowledge graph. Among the current studies, text-based methods complete the task by utilizing textual descriptions of triples. However, this modeling approach may encounter limitations, particularly when the description fails to accurately and adequately express the intended meaning. To overcome these challenges, we propose the augmentation of data through two additional mechanisms. Firstly, we employ ChatGPT as an external knowledge base to generate coherent descriptions to bridge the semantic gap between the queries and answers. Secondly, we leverage inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby creating extra labeling and providing supplementary information for link prediction. This approach offers additional insights into the relationships between entities. Through these efforts, we have observed significant improvements in knowledge graph completion, as these mechanisms enhance the richness and diversity of the available data, leading to more accurate results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior Bilinear Based Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13834v1)** | 2023-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bilinear based models are powerful and widely used approaches for Knowledge Graphs Completion (KGC). Although bilinear based models have achieved significant advances, these studies mainly concentrate on posterior properties (based on evidence, e.g. symmetry pattern) while neglecting the prior properties. In this paper, we find a prior property named "the law of identity" that cannot be captured by bilinear based models, which hinders them from comprehensively modeling the characteristics of KGs. To address this issue, we introduce a solution called Unit Ball Bilinear Model (UniBi). This model not only achieves theoretical superiority but also offers enhanced interpretability and performance by minimizing ineffective learning through minimal constraints. Experiments demonstrate that UniBi models the prior property and verify its interpretability and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACTC: Active Threshold Calibration for Cold-Start Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06395v3)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised knowledge-graph completion (KGC) relies on estimating a scoring model over (entity, relation, entity)-tuples, for example, by embedding an initial knowledge graph. Prediction quality can be improved by calibrating the scoring model, typically by adjusting the prediction thresholds using manually annotated examples. In this paper, we attempt for the first time cold-start calibration for KGC, where no annotated examples exist initially for calibration, and only a limited number of tuples can be selected for annotation. Our new method ACTC finds good per-relation thresholds efficiently based on a limited set of annotated tuples. Additionally to a few annotated tuples, ACTC also leverages unlabeled tuples by estimating their correctness with Logistic Regression or Gaussian Process classifiers. We also experiment with different methods for selecting candidate tuples for annotation: density-based and random selection. Experiments with five scoring models and an oracle annotator show an improvement of 7% points when using ACTC in the challenging setting with an annotation budget of only 10 tuples, and an average improvement of 4% points over different budgets.</p></details> | ACL'23 |

Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules. We conduct extensive experiments to validate that our MKGformer can obtain SOTA performance on four datasets of multimodal link prediction, multimodal RE, and multimodal NER.

However, current subsampling approaches consider only frequencies of queries that consist of entities and their relations. Thus, the existing subsampling potentially underestimates the appearance probabilities of infrequent queries even if the frequencies of their entities or relations are high. To address this problem, we propose Model-based Subsampling (MBS) and Mixed Subsampling (MIX) to estimate their appearance probabilities through predictions of KGE models. Evaluation results on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 showed that our proposed subsampling methods actually improved the KG completion performances for popular KGE models, RotatE, TransE, HAKE, ComplEx, and DistMult.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AACL 2023; 9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

| **[Extending Transductive Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Inductive Logical Relational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many downstream inference tasks for knowledge graphs, such as relation prediction, have been handled successfully by knowledge graph embedding techniques in the transductive setting. To address the inductive setting wherein new entities are introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time, more recent work opts for models which learn implicit representations of the knowledge graph through a complex function of a network's subgraph structure, often parametrized by graph neural network architectures. These come at the cost of increased parametrization, reduced interpretability and limited generalization to other downstream inference tasks. In this work, we bridge the gap between traditional transductive knowledge graph embedding approaches and more recent inductive relation prediction models by introducing a generalized form of harmonic extension which leverages representations learned through transductive embedding methods to infer representations of new entities introduced at inference time as in the inductive setting. This harmonic extension technique provides the best such approximation, can be implemented via an efficient iterative scheme, and can be employed to answer a family of conjunctive logical queries over the knowledge graph, further expanding the capabilities of transductive embedding methods. In experiments on a number of large-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, we find that this approach for extending the functionality of transductive knowledge graph embedding models to perform knowledge graph completion and answer logical queries in the inductive setting is competitive with--and in some scenarios outperforms--several state-of-the-art models derived explicitly for such inductive tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iteratively Learning Representations for Unseen Entities with Inter-Rule Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10531v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on knowledge graph completion (KGC) focused on learning embeddings of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. These embedding methods require that all test entities are observed at training time, resulting in a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities. To address this issue, current inductive knowledge embedding methods employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating information of known neighbors. They face three important challenges: (i) data sparsity, (ii) the presence of complex patterns in knowledge graphs (e.g., inter-rule correlations), and (iii) the presence of interactions among rule mining, rule inference, and embedding. In this paper, we propose a virtual neighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) that consists of three stages: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. In the rule mining process, to identify complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic rules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on operations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual neighbors for OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a rule-constrained problem. We also devise an iterative framework to capture the underlying relations between rule learning and embedding learning. In our experiments, results on both link prediction and triple classification tasks show that the proposed VNC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used knowledge graphs. Further analysis reveals that VNC is robust to the proportion of unseen entities and effectively mitigates data sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[On the Aggregation of Rules for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00306v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rule learning approaches for knowledge graph completion are efficient, interpretable and competitive to purely neural models. The rule aggregation problem is concerned with finding one plausibility score for a candidate fact which was simultaneously predicted by multiple rules. Although the problem is ubiquitous, as data-driven rule learning can result in noisy and large rulesets, it is underrepresented in the literature and its theoretical foundations have not been studied before in this context. In this work, we demonstrate that existing aggregation approaches can be expressed as marginal inference operations over the predicting rules. In particular, we show that the common Max-aggregation strategy, which scores candidates based on the rule with the highest confidence, has a probabilistic interpretation. Finally, we propose an efficient and overlooked baseline which combines the previous strategies and is competitive to computationally more expensive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>KLR W...</summary><p>KLR Workshop@ICML2023</p></details> |

While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)</p></details> |

Existing methods can mainly be categorized into structure-based or description-based. On the one hand, structure-based methods effectively represent relational facts in knowledge graphs using entity embeddings. However, they struggle with semantically rich real-world entities due to limited structural information and fail to generalize to unseen entities. On the other hand, description-based methods leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to understand textual information. They exhibit strong robustness towards unseen entities. However, they have difficulty with larger negative sampling and often lag behind structure-based methods. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose Momentum Contrast for knowledge graph completion with Structure-Augmented pre-trained language models (MoCoSA), which allows the PLM to perceive the structural information by the adaptable structure encoder. To improve learning efficiency, we proposed momentum hard negative and intra-relation negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with improvements of 2.5% on WN18RR and 21% on OpenBG500.</p></details> |  |

Relational patterns which refer to relations with specific semantics exhibiting graph patterns are an important factor in the performance of KGE models. Though KGE models' capabilities are analyzed over different relational patterns in theory and a rough connection between better relational patterns modeling and better performance of KGC has been built, a comprehensive quantitative analysis on KGE models over relational patterns remains absent so it is uncertain how the theoretical support of KGE to a relational pattern contributes to the performance of triples associated to such a relational pattern. To address this challenge, we evaluate the performance of 7 KGE models over 4 common relational patterns on 2 benchmarks, then conduct an analysis in theory, entity frequency, and part-to-whole three aspects and get some counterintuitive conclusions. Finally, we introduce a training-free method Score-based Patterns Adaptation (SPA) to enhance KGE models' performance over various relational patterns. This approach is simple yet effective and can be applied to KGE models without additional training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method generally enhances performance over specific relational patterns.

MMKGC enhances knowledge graph completion (KGC) by integrating multi-modal entity information, thereby facilitating the discovery of unobserved triples in the large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Nevertheless, existing methods emphasize the design of elegant KGC models to facilitate modality interaction, neglecting the real-life problem of missing modalities in KGs. The missing modality information impedes modal interaction, consequently undermining the model's performance. In this paper, we propose a modality adversarial and contrastive framework (MACO) to solve the modality-missing problem in MMKGC. MACO trains a generator and discriminator adversarially to generate missing modality features that can be incorporated into the MMKGC model. Meanwhile, we design a cross-modal contrastive loss to improve the performance of the generator. Experiments on public benchmarks with further explorations demonstrate that MACO could achieve state-of-the-art results and serve as a versatile framework to bolster various MMKGC models.

| **[HyperFormer: Enhancing Entity and Relation Interaction for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06512v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) extend standard knowledge graphs by associating attribute-value qualifiers to triples, which effectively represent additional fine-grained information about its associated triple. Hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) aims at inferring unknown triples while considering its qualifiers. Most existing approaches to HKGC exploit a global-level graph structure to encode hyper-relational knowledge into the graph convolution message passing process. However, the addition of multi-hop information might bring noise into the triple prediction process. To address this problem, we propose HyperFormer, a model that considers local-level sequential information, which encodes the content of the entities, relations and qualifiers of a triple. More precisely, HyperFormer is composed of three different modules: an entity neighbor aggregator module allowing to integrate the information of the neighbors of an entity to capture different perspectives of it; a relation qualifier aggregator module to integrate hyper-relational knowledge into the corresponding relation to refine the representation of relational content; a convolution-based bidirectional interaction module based on a convolutional operation, capturing pairwise bidirectional interactions of entity-relation, entity-qualifier, and relation-qualifier. realize the depth perception of the content related to the current statement. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy into the feed-forward layers of HyperFormer to strengthen its representation capabilities while reducing the amount of model parameters and computation. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets with four different conditions demonstrate HyperFormer's effectiveness. Datasets and code are available at https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/HKGC-HyperFormer.</p></details> | Accepted at CIKM'23 |

However, they usually cannot avoid rule grounding, and injecting a diverse set of rules has still not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we propose InjEx, a mechanism to inject multiple types of rules through simple constraints, which capture definite Horn rules. To start, we theoretically prove that InjEx can inject such rules. Next, to demonstrate that InjEx infuses interpretable prior knowledge into the embedding space, we evaluate InjEx on both the knowledge graph completion (KGC) and few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) settings. Our experimental results reveal that InjEx outperforms both baseline KGC models as well as specialized few-shot models while maintaining its scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, TKGs often suffer from incompleteness for three main reasons: the continuous emergence of new knowledge, the weakness of the algorithm for extracting structured information from unstructured data, and the lack of information in the source dataset. Thus, the task of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) has attracted increasing attention, aiming to predict missing items based on the available information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on the algorithms they utilize. We further pinpoint the challenges and discuss future research directions of TKGC.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different description logic axioms. We conclude the paper with a critical reflection on the current state of work in the community and give recommendations for future directions.</p></details> |  |

However, KGE models often only briefly learn structural correlations of triple data and embeddings would be misled by the trivial patterns and noisy links in real-world KGs. To address this issue, we build the new paradigm of KGE in the context of causality and embedding disentanglement. We further propose a Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding (CausE) framework. CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CausE could outperform the baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art KGC performance.

However, the currently constructed knowledge graphs need to be complemented for better knowledge in terms of relations. It is called knowledge graph completion. To add new relations to the existing knowledge graph by using knowledge graph embedding models, we have to evaluate $N\times N \times R$ vector operations, where $N$ is the number of entities and $R$ is the number of relation types. It is very costly. In this paper, we provide an efficient knowledge graph completion framework on GPUs to get new relations using knowledge graph embedding vectors. In the proposed framework, we first define "transformable to a metric space" and then provide a method to transform the knowledge graph completion problem into the similarity join problem for a model which is "transformable to a metric space". After that, to efficiently process the similarity join problem, we derive formulas using the properties of a metric space. Based on the formulas, we develop a fast knowledge graph completion algorithm. Finally, we experimentally show that our framework can efficiently process the knowledge graph completion problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separate-and-Aggregate: A Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05627v1)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of inferencing missing facts from any given knowledge graphs (KG). Previous KGC methods typically represent knowledge graph entities and relations as trainable continuous embeddings and fuse the embeddings of the entity $h$ (or $t$) and relation $r$ into hidden representations of query $(h, r, ?)$ (or $(?, r, t$)) to approximate the missing entities. To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness of our model design choices in PatReFormer. We then find that PatReFormer can better capture KG information from a large relation embedding dimension. Finally, we demonstrate that the strength of PatReFormer is at complex relation types, compared to other KGC models</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ADMA 2023, oral</p></details> |

Most prior KGC work focuses on learning embeddings for entities and relations through a simple scoring function. Yet, a higher-dimensional embedding space is usually required for a better reasoning capability, which leads to a larger model size and hinders applicability to real-world problems (e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile/edge computing). A lightweight modularized KGC solution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this work to address this issue. GreenKGC consists of three modules: representation learning, feature pruning, and decision learning, to extract discriminant KG features and make accurate predictions on missing relationships using classifiers and negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that, in low dimensions, GreenKGC can outperform SOTA methods in most datasets. In addition, low-dimensional GreenKGC can achieve competitive or even better performance against high-dimensional models with a much smaller model size.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL2023 |

Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used to learn the textual information, usually under the fine-tune paradigm for the KGC task. However, the fine-tuned PLMs often overwhelmingly focus on the textual information and overlook structural knowledge. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes CSProm-KG (Conditional Soft Prompts for KGC) which maintains a balance between structural information and textual knowledge. CSProm-KG only tunes the parameters of Conditional Soft Prompts that are generated by the entities and relations representations.

| **[Are Message Passing Neural Networks Really Helpful for Knowledge Graph Completion?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10652v3)** | 2023-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) facilitate a wide variety of applications. Despite great efforts in creation and maintenance, even the largest KGs are far from complete. Hence, KG completion (KGC) has become one of the most crucial tasks for KG research. Recently, considerable literature in this space has centered around the use of Message Passing (Graph) Neural Networks (MPNNs), to learn powerful embeddings. The success of these methods is naturally attributed to the use of MPNNs over simpler multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, given their additional message passing (MP) component. In this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve comparable performance to MPNNs, suggesting that MP may not be as crucial as previously believed. With further exploration, we show careful scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC model performance. This suggests a conflation of scoring function design, loss function design, and MP in prior work, with promising insights regarding the scalability of state-of-the-art KGC methods today, as well as careful attention to more suitable MP designs for KGC tasks tomorrow. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Juanhui28/Are_MPNNs_helpful.</p></details> |  |

This problem is also exacerbated because of the widespread existence of sparse KGs in practical applications. To alleviate this challenge, we present a novel framework, LR-GCN, that is able to automatically capture valuable long-range dependency among entities to supplement insufficient structure features and distill logical reasoning knowledge for sparse KGC. The proposed approach comprises two main components: a GNN-based predictor and a reasoning path distiller. The reasoning path distiller explores high-order graph structures such as reasoning paths and encodes them as rich-semantic edges, explicitly compositing long-range dependencies into the predictor. This step also plays an essential role in densifying KGs, effectively alleviating the sparse issue. Furthermore, the path distiller further distills logical reasoning knowledge from these mined reasoning paths into the predictor. These two components are jointly optimized using a well-designed variational EM algorithm. Extensive experiments and analyses on four sparse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Among those, several works have achieved more advanced results via exploiting the structure information on KGs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). However, we observe that entity embeddings aggregated from neighbors in different directions are just simply averaged to complete single-tasks by existing GCN based models, ignoring the specific requirements of forward and backward sub-tasks. In this paper, we propose a Direction-sensitive Multi-task GCN (DsMtGCN) to make full use of the direction information, the multi-head self-attention is applied to specifically combine embeddings in different directions based on various entities and sub-tasks, the geometric constraints are imposed to adjust the distribution of embeddings, and the traditional binary cross-entropy loss is modified to reflect the triple uncertainty. Moreover, the competitive experiments results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches randomly select one negative sample for each reference entity pair to minimize a margin-based ranking loss, which easily leads to a zero-loss problem if the negative sample is far away from the positive sample and then out of the margin. Moreover, the entity should have a different representation under a different context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss (RANA) framework. Specifically, to better utilize the plentiful negative samples and alleviate the zero-loss issue, we strategically select relevant negative samples and design an attention-based loss function to further differentiate the importance of each negative sample. The intuition is that negative samples more similar to positive samples will contribute more to the model. Further, we design a dynamic relation-aware entity encoder for learning a context-dependent entity representation. Experiments demonstrate that RANA outperforms the state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference PAKDD 2023</p></details> |
| **[Contextual Dictionary Lookup for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07719v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to solve the incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) by predicting missing links from known triples, numbers of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been proposed to perform KGC by learning embeddings. Nevertheless, most existing embedding models map each relation into a unique vector, overlooking the specific fine-grained semantics of them under different entities. Additionally, the few available fine-grained semantic models rely on clustering algorithms, resulting in limited performance and applicability due to the cumbersome two-stage training process. In this paper, we present a novel method utilizing contextual dictionary lookup, enabling conventional embedding models to learn fine-grained semantics of relations in an end-to-end manner. More specifically, we represent each relation using a dictionary that contains multiple latent semantics. The composition of a given entity and the dictionary's central semantics serves as the context for generating a lookup, thus determining the fine-grained semantics of the relation adaptively. The proposed loss function optimizes both the central and fine-grained semantics simultaneously to ensure their semantic consistency. Besides, we introduce two metrics to assess the validity and accuracy of the dictionary lookup operation. We extend several KGE models with the method, resulting in substantial performance improvements on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Few-Shot Inductive Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs using Confidence-Augmented Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00613v2)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) aims to predict the missing links among the entities in a temporal knwoledge graph (TKG). Most previous TKGC methods only consider predicting the missing links among the entities seen in the training set, while they are unable to achieve great performance in link prediction concerning newly-emerged unseen entities. Recently, a new task, i.e., TKG few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction, is proposed, where TKGC models are required to achieve great link prediction performance concerning newly-emerged entities that only have few-shot observed examples. In this work, we propose a TKGC method FITCARL that combines few-shot learning with reinforcement learning to solve this task. In FITCARL, an agent traverses through the whole TKG to search for the prediction answer. A policy network is designed to guide the search process based on the traversed path. To better address the data scarcity problem in the few-shot setting, we introduce a module that computes the confidence of each candidate action and integrate it into the policy for action selection. We also exploit the entity concept information with a novel concept regularizer to boost model performance. Experimental results show that FITCARL achieves stat-of-the-art performance on TKG few-shot OOG link prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML/PKDD 2023</p></details> |

A key feature of Machine Learning approaches for KG completion is their ability to learn inference patterns, so that the predicted facts are the results of applying these patterns to the KG. Standard completion benchmarks, however, are not well-suited for evaluating models' abilities to learn patterns, because the training and test sets of these benchmarks are a random split of a given KG and hence do not capture the causality of inference patterns. We propose a novel approach for designing KG completion benchmarks based on the following principles: there is a set of logical rules so that the missing facts are the results of the rules' application; the training set includes both premises matching rule antecedents and the corresponding conclusions; the test set consists of the results of applying the rules to the training set; the negative examples are designed to discourage the models from learning rules not entailed by the rule set. We use our methodology to generate several benchmarks and evaluate a wide range of existing KG completion systems. Our results provide novel insights on the ability of existing models to induce inference patterns from incomplete KGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2023)</p></details> |

RE serves as the foundation for many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as knowledge graph completion, question answering, and information retrieval. In recent years, deep neural networks have dominated the field of RE and made noticeable progress. Subsequently, the large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have taken the state-of-the-art of RE to a new level. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing deep learning techniques for RE. First, we introduce RE resources, including RE datasets and evaluation metrics. Second, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing works from three perspectives (text representation, context encoding, and triplet prediction). Third, we discuss several important challenges faced by RE and summarize potential techniques to tackle these challenges. Finally, we outline some promising future directions and prospects in this field. This survey is expected to facilitate researchers' collaborative efforts to tackle the challenges of real-life RE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Neural Networks on Matrix Manifolds: A Gyrovector Space Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04560v3)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix manifolds, such as manifolds of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and Grassmann manifolds, appear in many applications. Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[History Repeats: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting For Event-Centric Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18675v1)** | 2023-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) completion models typically rely on having access to the entire graph during training. However, in real-world scenarios, TKG data is often received incrementally as events unfold, leading to a dynamic non-stationary data distribution over time. While one could incorporate fine-tuning to existing methods to allow them to adapt to evolving TKG data, this can lead to forgetting previously learned patterns. Alternatively, retraining the model with the entire updated TKG can mitigate forgetting but is computationally burdensome. To address these challenges, we propose a general continual training framework that is applicable to any TKG completion method, and leverages two key ideas: (i) a temporal regularization that encourages repurposing of less important model parameters for learning new knowledge, and (ii) a clustering-based experience replay that reinforces the past knowledge by selectively preserving only a small portion of the past data. Our experimental results on widely used event-centric TKG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed continual training framework in adapting to new events while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Further, we perform ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each component of our proposed framework. Finally, we investigate the relation between the memory dedicated to experience replay and the benefit gained from our clustering-based sampling strategy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Different nodes may represent the same concept. This leads to the problems of edge sparsity and node redundancy, which challenges CSKG representation and completion. On the one hand, edge sparsity limits the performance of graph representation learning; On the other hand, node redundancy makes different nodes corresponding to the same concept have inconsistent relations with other nodes. To address the two problems, we propose a new CSKG completion framework based on Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering (CPNC). Contrastive Pretraining constructs positive and negative head-tail node pairs on CSKG and utilizes contrastive learning to obtain better semantic node representation. Node Clustering aggregates nodes with the same concept into a latent concept, assisting the task of CSKG completion. We evaluate our CPNC approach on two CSKG completion benchmarks (CN-100K and ATOMIC), where CPNC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering can significantly improve the performance of CSKG completion. The source code of CPNC is publicly available on \url{https://github.com/NUSTM/CPNC}.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2023 |

However, the predictive power of KGC methods is often limited by the completeness of the existing knowledge graphs from different sources and languages. In monolingual and multilingual settings, KGs are potentially complementary to each other. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-KG completion, where we focus on maximizing the collective knowledge from different KGs to alleviate the incompleteness of individual KGs. Specifically, we propose a novel method called CKGC-CKD that uses relation-aware graph convolutional network encoder models on both individual KGs and a large fused KG in which seed alignments between KGs are regarded as edges for message propagation. An additional mutual knowledge distillation mechanism is also employed to maximize the knowledge transfer between the models of "global" fused KG and the "local" individual KGs. Experimental results on multilingual datasets have shown that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the KGC task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ENLSP-II workshop at NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |

Existing works that augment KG completion require either (1) factual triples to enlarge the graph reasoning space or (2) manually designed prompts to extract knowledge from a pre-trained language model (PLM), exhibiting limited performance and requiring expensive efforts from experts. To this end, we propose TAGREAL that automatically generates quality query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLM for KG completion. The results show that TAGREAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. We find that TAGREAL has superb performance even with limited training data, outperforming existing embedding-based, graph-based, and PLM-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables.

| **[To Copy Rather Than Memorize: A Vertical Learning Paradigm for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14126v1)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models have shown great power in knowledge graph completion (KGC) task. By learning structural constraints for each training triple, these methods implicitly memorize intrinsic relation rules to infer missing links. However, this paper points out that the multi-hop relation rules are hard to be reliably memorized due to the inherent deficiencies of such implicit memorization strategy, making embedding models underperform in predicting links between distant entity pairs. To alleviate this problem, we present Vertical Learning Paradigm (VLP), which extends embedding models by allowing to explicitly copy target information from related factual triples for more accurate prediction. Rather than solely relying on the implicit memory, VLP directly provides additional cues to improve the generalization ability of embedding models, especially making the distant link prediction significantly easier. Moreover, we also propose a novel relative distance based negative sampling technique (ReD) for more effective optimization. Experiments demonstrate the validity and generality of our proposals on two standard benchmarks.

It learns logical rules to predict missing edges by reasoning on existing edges in the knowledge graph. However, previous efforts have largely been limited to only modeling chain-like Horn clauses such as $R_1(x,z)\land R_2(z,y)\Rightarrow H(x,y)$. This formulation overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of entity variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. Intuitively, there is a large gap here, as local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical functions on the entity's neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules. LERP can also be further combined with embedding learning methods like TransE to make it more interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures; accepted by 11th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023)</p></details> |

Specifically, we first propose a dynamic pruning technique to obtain a small pruned model from a large source model, where the pruning mask of the pruned model could be updated adaptively per epoch after the model weights are updated. The pruned model is supposed to be more sensitive to difficult to memorize samples(e.g., longtail samples) than the source model. Then, we propose a onestep meta selfdistillation method for distilling comprehensive knowledge from the source model to the pruned model, where the two models coevolve in a dynamic manner during training. In particular, we exploit the performance of the pruned model, which is trained alongside the source model in one iteration, to improve the source models knowledge transfer ability for the next iteration via meta learning. Extensive experiments show that MetaSD achieves competitive performance compared to strong baselines, while being 10x smaller than baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the lack of a large-scale, comprehensive, and easy-to-use resource capturing the myriad relationships between publications, their authors, and venues presents a barrier to applications for gaining a deeper understanding of science. In this paper, we present PubGraph, a new resource for studying scientific progress that takes the form of a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) with more than 385M entities, 13B main edges, and 1.5B qualifier edges. PubGraph is comprehensive and unifies data from various sources, including Wikidata, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, using the Wikidata ontology. Beyond the metadata available from these sources, PubGraph includes outputs from auxiliary community detection algorithms and large language models. To further support studies on reasoning over scientific networks, we create several large-scale benchmarks extracted from PubGraph for the core task of knowledge graph completion (KGC). These benchmarks present many challenges for knowledge graph embedding models, including an adversarial community-based KGC evaluation setting, zero-shot inductive learning, and large-scale learning. All of the aforementioned resources are accessible at https://pubgraph.isi.edu/ and released under the CC-BY-SA license.

Knowledge graphs are often incomplete in the information they represent, necessitating the need for knowledge graph completion tasks. Pre-trained and fine-tuned language models have shown promise in these tasks although these models ignore the intrinsic information encoded in the knowledge graph, namely the entity and relation types. In this work, we propose the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) architecture, where we introduce a new entity/relation embedding layer that learns to differentiate distinctive entity and relation types, therefore allowing the model to learn the structure of the knowledge graph. In this work, we show that further pre-training the language models with this additional embedding layer using the triples extracted from the knowledge graph, followed by the standard fine-tuning phase sets a new state-of-the-art performance for the link prediction task on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, relation labeling in KGs remains a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce domains and the associated cost of human labor. Recently, breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising results in numerous natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of LLMs for relation labeling in e-commerce KGs, investigating their powerful learning capabilities in natural language and effectiveness in predicting relations between product types with limited labeled data. We evaluate various LLMs, including PaLM and GPT-3.5, on benchmark datasets, demonstrating their ability to achieve competitive performance compared to humans on relation labeling tasks using just 1 to 5 labeled examples per relation. Additionally, we experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to examine their impact on model performance. Our results show that LLMs significantly outperform existing KG completion models in relation labeling for e-commerce KGs and exhibit performance strong enough to replace human labeling.</p></details> |  |

The KGC methods fall into multiple categories including embedding-based, rule-based, GNN-based, pretrained Language Model based approaches. However, such dimensions have not been explored in TKG. To that end, we propose a novel temporal neuro-symbolic model, NeuSTIP, that performs link prediction and time interval prediction in a TKG. NeuSTIP learns temporal rules in the presence of the Allen predicates that ensure the temporal consistency between neighboring predicates in a given rule. We further design a unique scoring function that evaluates the confidence of the candidate answers while performing link prediction and time interval prediction by utilizing the learned rules. Our empirical evaluation on two time interval based TKGC datasets suggests that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for both link prediction and the time interval prediction task.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 Figures |

Predicting events is extremely challenging due to the time-sensitive property of events. Besides, the previous TKG completion (TKGC) approaches cannot represent both the timeliness and the causality properties of events, simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a Logic and Commonsense-Guided Embedding model (LCGE) to jointly learn the time-sensitive representation involving timeliness and causality of events, together with the time-independent representation of events from the perspective of commonsense. Specifically, we design a temporal rule learning algorithm to construct a rule-guided predicate embedding regularization strategy for learning the causality among events. Furthermore, we could accurately evaluate the plausibility of events via auxiliary commonsense knowledge. The experimental results of TKGC task illustrate the significant performance improvements of our model compared with the existing approaches. More interestingly, our model is able to provide the explainability of the predicted results in the view of causal inference.

Companies do not only need to react to a dynamic environment but have to act proactively and implement measures to prevent production delays and reduce risks in the supply chains. However, information about supply chains, especially at the deeper levels, is often intransparent and incomplete, making it difficult to obtain precise predictions about prospective risks. By connecting different data sources, we model the supply network as a knowledge graph and achieve transparency up to tier-3 suppliers. To predict missing information in the graph, we apply state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods and attain a mean reciprocal rank of 0.4377 with the best model. Further, we apply graph analysis algorithms to identify critical entities in the supply network, supporting supply chain managers in automated risk identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the D2R2 workshop (ESWC 2023)</p></details> |

We survey methods that underly geometric relational embeddings and categorize them based on (i) the embedding geometries that are used to represent the data; and (ii) the relational reasoning tasks that they aim to improve.

Recently, few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations with few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from practitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on metric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the out-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent at estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as model predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore, most of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in KGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a normalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion (NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to model a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel way to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty. Then, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural process and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve performance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network to capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the existing FKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Traditional embedding-based TKGC models (TKGE) rely on structured connections and can only handle a fixed set of entities, i.e., the transductive setting. In the inductive setting where test TKGs contain emerging entities, the latest methods are based on symbolic rules or pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, they suffer from being inflexible and not time-specific, respectively. In this work, we extend the fully-inductive setting, where entities in the training and test sets are totally disjoint, into TKGs and take a further step towards a more flexible and time-sensitive temporal relation prediction approach SST-BERT, incorporating Structured Sentences with Time-enhanced BERT. Our model can obtain the entity history and implicitly learn rules in the semantic space by encoding structured sentences, solving the problem of inflexibility. We propose to use a time masking MLM task to pre-train BERT in a corpus rich in temporal tokens specially generated for TKGs, enhancing the time sensitivity of SST-BERT. To compute the probability of occurrence of a target quadruple, we aggregate all its structured sentences from both temporal and semantic perspectives into a score. Experiments on the transductive datasets and newly generated fully-inductive benchmarks show that SST-BERT successfully improves over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training Transformers for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15682v1)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning transferable representation of knowledge graphs (KGs) is challenging due to the heterogeneous, multi-relational nature of graph structures. Inspired by Transformer-based pretrained language models' success on learning transferable representation for texts, we introduce a novel inductive KG representation model (iHT) for KG completion by large-scale pre-training. iHT consists of a entity encoder (e.g., BERT) and a neighbor-aware relational scoring function both parameterized by Transformers. We first pre-train iHT on a large KG dataset, Wikidata5M. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on matched evaluations, with a relative improvement of more than 25% in mean reciprocal rank over previous SOTA models. When further fine-tuned on smaller KGs with either entity and relational shifts, pre-trained iHT representations are shown to be transferable, significantly improving the performance on FB15K-237 and WN18RR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Graph Algorithms to Pretrain Graph Completion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07453v2)** | 2023-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on Graph Neural Networks has demonstrated that self-supervised pretraining can further enhance performance on downstream graph, link, and node classification tasks. However, the efficacy of pretraining tasks has not been fully investigated for downstream large knowledge graph completion tasks. Using a contextualized knowledge graph embedding approach, we investigate five different pretraining signals, constructed using several graph algorithms and no external data, as well as their combination. We leverage the versatility of our Transformer-based model to explore graph structure generation pretraining tasks (i.e. path and k-hop neighborhood generation), typically inapplicable to most graph embedding methods. We further propose a new path-finding algorithm guided by information gain and find that it is the best-performing pretraining task across three downstream knowledge graph completion datasets. While using our new path-finding algorithm as a pretraining signal provides 2-3% MRR improvements, we show that pretraining on all signals together gives the best knowledge graph completion results. In a multitask setting that combines all pretraining tasks, our method surpasses the latest and strong performing knowledge graph embedding methods on all metrics for FB15K-237, on MRR and Hit@1 for WN18RRand on MRR and hit@10 for JF17K (a knowledge hypergraph dataset).</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, training KGEs on non-English knowledge graph promote knowledge extraction and knowledge graph reasoning in the context of these languages. However, many challenges in non-English KGEs pose to learning a low-dimensional representation of a knowledge graph's entities and relations. This paper proposes "Farspredict" a Persian knowledge graph based on Farsbase (the most comprehensive knowledge graph in Persian). It also explains how the knowledge graph structure affects link prediction accuracy in KGE. To evaluate Farspredict, we implemented the popular models of KGE on it and compared the results with Freebase. Given the analysis results, some optimizations on the knowledge graph are carried out to improve its functionality in the KGE. As a result, a new Persian knowledge graph is achieved. Implementation results in the KGE models on Farspredict outperforming Freebases in many cases. At last, we discuss what improvements could be effective in enhancing the quality of Farspredict and how much it improves.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 1 algorithm and 5 tables</p></details> |

Graph as representation for knowledge has several drawbacks like data sparsity, computational complexity and manual feature engineering. Knowledge Graph embedding tackles the drawback by representing entities and relation in low dimensional vector space by capturing the semantic relation between them. There are different KG embedding models. Here, we discuss translation based and neural network based embedding models which differ based on semantic property, scoring function and architecture they use. Further, we discuss application of KG in some domains that use deep learning models and leverage social media data.</p></details> |  |

However, we found that inherent heterogeneity among factor tensors in tensor decomposition significantly hinders the tensor fusion process and further limits the performance of link prediction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method that maps factor tensors onto a unified smooth Lie group manifold to make the distribution of factor tensors approximating homogeneous in tensor decomposition. We provide the theoretical proof of our motivation that homogeneous tensors are more effective than heterogeneous tensors in tensor fusion and approximating the target for tensor decomposition based TKGE methods. The proposed method can be directly integrated into existing tensor decomposition based TKGE methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the heterogeneity and in enhancing the tensor decomposition based TKGE models.</p></details> |  |

Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables.

| **[Do Similar Entities have Similar Embeddings?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10370v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) developed for link prediction learn vector representations for entities in a knowledge graph, known as embeddings. A common tacit assumption is the KGE entity similarity assumption, which states that these KGEMs retain the graph's structure within their embedding space, \textit{i.e.}, position similar entities within the graph close to one another. This desirable property make KGEMs widely used in downstream tasks such as recommender systems or drug repurposing. Yet, the relation of entity similarity and similarity in the embedding space has rarely been formally evaluated. Typically, KGEMs are assessed based on their sole link prediction capabilities, using ranked-based metrics such as Hits@K or Mean Rank. This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that entity similarity in the graph is inherently mirrored in the embedding space. Therefore, we conduct extensive experiments to measure the capability of KGEMs to cluster similar entities together, and investigate the nature of the underlying factors. Moreover, we study if different KGEMs expose a different notion of similarity. Datasets, pre-trained embeddings and code are available at: https://github.com/nicolas-hbt/similar-embeddings/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESWC 2024</p></details> |

Experiments on six benchmarks with two popular LLMs and three knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of KnowLA.

However, noun phrases and relational phrases in OKBs often suffer from redundancy and ambiguity, which calls for the investigation on OKB canonicalization. Current solutions address OKB canonicalization by devising advanced clustering algorithms and using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to further facilitate the canonicalization process. Nevertheless, these works fail to fully exploit the synergy between clustering and KGE learning, and the methods designed for these subtasks are sub-optimal. To this end, we put forward a multi-task learning framework, namely MulCanon, to tackle OKB canonicalization. In addition, diffusion model is used in the soft clustering process to improve the noun phrase representations with neighboring information, which can lead to more accurate representations. MulCanon unifies the learning objectives of these sub-tasks, and adopts a two-stage multi-task learning paradigm for training. A thorough experimental study on popular OKB canonicalization benchmarks validates that MulCanon can achieve competitive canonicalization results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.16419</p></details> |

In this paper, we link knowledge graph completion and counterfactual reasoning via our new task CFKGR. We model the original world state as a knowledge graph, hypothetical scenarios as edges added to the graph, and plausible changes to the graph as inferences from logical rules. We create corresponding benchmark datasets, which contain diverse hypothetical scenarios with plausible changes to the original knowledge graph and facts that should be retained. We develop COULDD, a general method for adapting existing knowledge graph embeddings given a hypothetical premise, and evaluate it on our benchmark. Our results indicate that KGEs learn patterns in the graph without explicit training. We further observe that KGEs adapted with COULDD solidly detect plausible counterfactual changes to the graph that follow these patterns. An evaluation on human-annotated data reveals that KGEs adapted with COULDD are mostly unable to recognize changes to the graph that do not follow learned inference rules. In contrast, ChatGPT mostly outperforms KGEs in detecting plausible changes to the graph but has poor knowledge retention. In summary, CFKGR connects two previously distinct areas, namely KG completion and counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2024</p></details> |

Different from the previous translation-based models, TransERR encodes knowledge graphs in the hypercomplex-valued space, thus enabling it to possess a higher degree of translation freedom in mining latent information between the head and tail entities. To further minimize the translation distance, TransERR adaptively rotates the head entity and the tail entity with their corresponding unit quaternions, which are learnable in model training. We also provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TransERR in modeling various relation patterns, including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition, and subrelation patterns. The experiments on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and the generalization of TransERR. The results also indicate that TransERR can better encode large-scale datasets with fewer parameters than the previous translation-based models. Our code and datasets are available at~\url{https://github.com/dellixx/TransERR}.</p></details> |  |

These optimal features typically depend on tunable parameters of the lower-level energy in such a way that the entire bilevel pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Although not generally presented as such, this paper demonstrates how a variety of graph learning techniques can be recast as special cases of bilevel optimization or simplifications thereof. In brief, building on prior work we first derive a more flexible class of energy functions that, when paired with various descent steps (e.g., gradient descent, proximal methods, momentum, etc.), form graph neural network (GNN) message-passing layers; critically, we also carefully unpack where any residual approximation error lies with respect to the underlying constituent message-passing functions. We then probe several simplifications of this framework to derive close connections with non-GNN-based graph learning approaches, including knowledge graph embeddings, various forms of label propagation, and efficient graph-regularized MLP models. And finally, we present supporting empirical results that demonstrate the versatility of the proposed bilevel lens, which we refer to as BloomGML, referencing that BiLevel Optimization Offers More Graph Machine Learning.

They are trained with loss functions that consider batches of true and false triples. However, different kinds of false triples exist and recent works suggest that they should not be valued equally, leading to specific negative sampling procedures. In line with this recent assumption, we posit that negative triples that are semantically valid w.r.t. signatures of relations (domain and range) are high-quality negatives. Hence, we enrich the three main loss functions for link prediction such that all kinds of negatives are sampled but treated differently based on their semantic validity. In an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed loss functions systematically provide satisfying results which demonstrates both the generality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss functions (1) lead to better MRR and Hits@10 values, and (2) drive KGEMs towards better semantic correctness as measured by the Sem@K metric. This highlights that relation signatures globally improve KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions. Domains and ranges of relations being largely available in schema-defined KGs, this makes our approach both beneficial and widely usable in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ESWC 2024</p></details> |

Embedding-based methods have shown effectiveness in addressing this problem by modeling relational patterns in triples. However, the link prediction task often requires contextual information in entity neighborhoods, while most existing embedding-based methods fail to capture it. Additionally, little attention is paid to the diversity of entity representations in different contexts, which often leads to false prediction results. In this situation, we consider that the schema of knowledge graph contains the specific contextual information, and it is beneficial for preserving the consistency of entities across contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel Schema-augmented Multi-level contrastive LEarning framework (SMiLE) to conduct knowledge graph link prediction. Specifically, we first exploit network schema as the prior constraint to sample negatives and pre-train our model by employing a multi-level contrastive learning method to yield both prior schema and contextual information. Then we fine-tune our model under the supervision of individual triples to learn subtler representations for link prediction. Extensive experimental results on four knowledge graph datasets with thorough analysis of each component demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework against state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of SMiLE is available at https://github.com/GKNL/SMiLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2022</p></details> |

These models aim to encode entities and relations present in a knowledge graph into a lower-dimensional vector space. During the training process of KGE models, using positive and negative samples becomes essential for discrimination purposes. However, obtaining negative samples directly from existing knowledge graphs poses a challenge, emphasizing the need for effective generation techniques. The quality of these negative samples greatly impacts the accuracy of the learned embeddings, making their generation a critical aspect of KGRL. This comprehensive survey paper systematically reviews various negative sampling (NS) methods and their contributions to the success of KGRL. Their respective advantages and disadvantages are outlined by categorizing existing NS methods into five distinct categories. Moreover, this survey identifies open research questions that serve as potential directions for future investigations. By offering a generalization and alignment of fundamental NS concepts, this survey provides valuable insights for designing effective NS methods in the context of KGRL and serves as a motivating force for further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |

The ability to perform complex logical reasoning is essential and supports various graph reasoning-based downstream tasks, such as search engines. Recent approaches are proposed to represent KG entities and logical queries into embedding vectors and find answers to logical queries from the KGs. However, existing proposed methods mainly focus on querying a single KG and cannot be applied to multiple graphs. In addition, directly sharing KGs with sensitive information may incur privacy risks, making it impractical to share and construct an aggregated KG for reasoning to retrieve query answers. Thus, it remains unknown how to answer queries on multi-source KGs. An entity can be involved in various knowledge graphs and reasoning on multiple KGs and answering complex queries on multi-source KGs is important in discovering knowledge cross graphs. Fortunately, federated learning is utilized in knowledge graphs to collaboratively learn representations with privacy preserved. Federated knowledge graph embeddings enrich the relations in knowledge graphs to improve the representation quality. However, these methods only focus on one-hop relations and cannot perform complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we apply federated learning to complex query-answering tasks to reason over multi-source knowledge graphs while preserving privacy. We propose a Federated Complex Query Answering framework (FedCQA), to reason over multi-source KGs avoiding sensitive raw data transmission to protect privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and evaluate retrieval performance on various types of complex queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction in Low Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13704v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been validated as powerful methods for inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KGs) that they typically map entities into Euclidean space and treat relations as transformations of entities. Recently, some Euclidean KGE methods have been enhanced to model semantic hierarchies commonly found in KGs, improving the performance of link prediction. To embed hierarchical data, hyperbolic space has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Euclidean space, offering high fidelity and lower memory consumption. Unlike Euclidean, hyperbolic space provides countless curvatures to choose from. However, it is difficult for existing hyperbolic KGE methods to obtain the optimal curvature settings manually, thereby limiting their ability to effectively model semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel KGE model called $\textbf{Hyp}$erbolic $\textbf{H}$ierarchical $\textbf{KGE}$ (HypHKGE). This model introduces attention-based learnable curvatures for hyperbolic space, which helps preserve rich semantic hierarchies. Furthermore, to utilize the preserved hierarchies for inferring missing links, we define hyperbolic hierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, including both inter-level and intra-level modeling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HypHKGE model on the three benchmark datasets (WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10). The source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wjzheng96/HypHKGE.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Despite these successes, a significant gap persists between generative models and the utilization of extensive biomedical knowledge, often systematized within knowledge graphs, whose potential to inform and enhance generative processes has not been realized. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges this divide by developing a framework for knowledge-enhanced generative models called K-DReAM. We develop a scalable methodology to extend the functionality of knowledge graphs while preserving semantic integrity and incorporate this contextual information into a generative framework to guide a diffusion-based model. The integration of knowledge graph embeddings with our generative model furnishes a robust mechanism for producing novel drug candidates possessing specific characteristics while ensuring validity and synthesizability. K-DReAM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on both unconditional and targeted generation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages |

These platforms, however, often feature posts as brief texts, posing challenges for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in understanding context. We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining community-maintained knowledge graphs (like Wikidata) with deep learning to enhance the categorization of social media posts. This method uses advanced entity recognizers and linkers (like Falcon 2.0) to connect short post entities to knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextualized word embeddings (like BERT) are then employed to create rich, context-based representations of these posts. Our focus is on the health domain, particularly in identifying posts related to eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia) to aid healthcare providers in early diagnosis. We tested our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders, finding that merging word embeddings with knowledge graph information enhances the predictive models' reliability. This methodology aims to assist health experts in spotting patterns indicative of mental disorders, thereby improving early detection and accurate diagnosis for personalized medicine.</p></details> |  |

Despite the superior performance of KGE models in practice, we discover a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular existing KGE models called \emph{Z-paradox}. Motivated by the existence of Z-paradox, we propose a new KGE model called \emph{MQuinE} that does not suffer from Z-paradox while preserves strong expressiveness to model various relation patterns including symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and composition relations with theoretical justification. Experiments on real-world knowledge bases indicate that Z-paradox indeed degrades the performance of existing KGE models, and can cause more than 20\% accuracy drop on some challenging test samples. Our experiments further demonstrate that MQuinE can mitigate the negative impact of Z-paradox and outperform existing KGE models by a visible margin on link prediction tasks.</p></details> | 18pages, 1 figure |

So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.</p></details> |  |

In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate with respect to a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to utter the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Play in this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we let LLMs act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performance uniformly improves on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLM's reasoning ability. The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, updating these models with new knowledge can be prohibitively expensive, yet it is essential for maximizing their utility. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective model editing approach, \textsc{MENT}, to patch LLMs in coding tasks. \textsc{MENT} is effective, efficient, and reliable. It can correct a neural model by patching 1 or 2 neurons. As the pioneer work on neuron-level model editing of generative models, we formalize the editing process and introduce the involved concepts. Besides, we also introduce new measures to evaluate its generalization ability, and build a benchmark for further study. Our approach is evaluated on three coding tasks, including API-seq recommendation, line-level code generation, and pseudocode-to-code transaction. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the arts by a significant margin in both effectiveness and efficiency measures. In addition, we demonstrate the usages of \textsc{MENT} for LLM reasoning in software engineering. By editing LLM knowledge, the directly or indirectly dependent behaviors of API invocation in the chain-of-thought will change accordingly. It explained the significance of repairing LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

However, they still face challenges in domain-specific knowledge. This paper aims to leverage LLMs' reasoning and recognition abilities to replace traditional user interfaces and create an "intelligent operating system" for transportation simulation software, exploring their potential with transportation modeling and simulation. We introduce Network Generation AI (NGAI), integrating LLMs with road network modeling plugins, validated through experiments for accuracy and robustness. NGAI's effective use has reduced modeling costs, revolutionized transportation simulations, optimized user steps, and proposed a novel approach for LLM integration in the transportation field.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Counter-intuitive: Large Language Models Can Better Understand Knowledge Graphs Than We Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11541v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the method of enhancing large language models' (LLMs') reasoning ability and reducing their hallucinations through the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) has received widespread attention, the exploration of how to enable LLMs to integrate the structured knowledge in KGs on-the-fly remains inadequate. Researchers often co-train KG embeddings and LLM parameters to equip LLMs with the ability of comprehending KG knowledge. However, this resource-hungry training paradigm significantly increases the model learning cost and is also unsuitable for non-open-source, black-box LLMs. In this paper, we employ complex question answering (CQA) as a task to assess the LLM's ability of comprehending KG knowledge. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of KG knowledge injection methods (from triples to natural language text), aiming to explore the optimal prompting method for supplying KG knowledge to LLMs, thereby enhancing their comprehension of KG. Contrary to our initial expectations, our analysis revealed that LLMs effectively handle messy, noisy, and linearized KG knowledge, outperforming methods that employ well-designed natural language (NL) textual prompts. This counter-intuitive finding provides substantial insights for future research on LLMs' comprehension of structured knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Evaluating Interventional Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05545v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system. As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial. A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions. Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention. We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning. These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts. Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4 models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, they remain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP). The analysis reveals interesting findings about different factors contributing to reasoning, including the reward-guidance, breadth-vs-depth in search, world model, and prompt formats, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.llm-reasoners.net/</p></details> |
| **[Deceptive Semantic Shortcuts on Reasoning Chains: How Far Can Models Go without Hallucination?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09702v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) and their high performances across numerous benchmarks, recent research has unveiled that LLMs suffer from hallucinations and unfaithful reasoning. This work studies a specific type of hallucination induced by semantic associations. Specifically, we investigate to what extent LLMs take shortcuts from certain keyword/entity biases in the prompt instead of following the correct reasoning path. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel probing method and benchmark called EureQA. We start from questions that LLMs will answer correctly with utmost certainty, and mask the important entity with evidence sentence recursively, asking models to find masked entities according to a chain of evidence before answering the question. During the construction of the evidence, we purposefully replace semantic clues (entities) that may lead to the correct answer with distractor clues (evidence) that will not directly lead to the correct answer but require a chain-like reasoning process. We evaluate if models can follow the correct reasoning chain instead of short-cutting through distractor clues. We find that existing LLMs lack the necessary capabilities to follow correct reasoning paths and resist the attempt of greedy shortcuts. We show that the distractor semantic associations often lead to model hallucination, which is strong evidence that questions the validity of current LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted by NAACL 2024</p></details> |

Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel approach to enhance LLMs' reasoning through attention mechanism optimization, without additional training data. We identify inefficiencies in the attention distribution caused by non-semantic tokens and propose an algorithm to re-balance the skewed distribution, enabling the model to abstract more nuanced knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved reasoning capabilities, particularly for non-STEM questions. We provide insights into the role of attention patterns in LLMs' reasoning and propose a method to enhance these abilities, paving the way for more powerful and versatile language models.</p></details> |  |

Controls provides an interesting case study for LLM reasoning due to its combination of mathematical theory and engineering design. We introduce ControlBench, a benchmark dataset tailored to reflect the breadth, depth, and complexity of classical control design. We use this dataset to study and evaluate the problem-solving abilities of these LLMs in the context of control engineering. We present evaluations conducted by a panel of human experts, providing insights into the accuracy, reasoning, and explanatory prowess of LLMs in control engineering. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each LLM in the context of classical control, and our results imply that Claude 3 Opus has become the state-of-the-art LLM for solving undergraduate control problems. Our study serves as an initial step towards the broader goal of employing artificial general intelligence in control engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\texttt{LM}^\texttt{2}$: A Simple Society of Language Models Solves Complex Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02255v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning. Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions. These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning. Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by $8.1\%$ on MATH, $7.71\%$ on JEEBench, and $9.7\%$ on MedQA problems (code available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/Language_Model_Multiplex).</p></details> |  |

Finetuned from Mistral-7B and CodeLlama-70B, Eurus models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. Notably, Eurus-70B beats GPT-3.5 Turbo in reasoning through a comprehensive benchmarking across 12 tests covering five tasks, and achieves a 33.3% pass@1 accuracy on LeetCode and 32.6% on TheoremQA, two challenging benchmarks, substantially outperforming existing open-source models by margins more than 13.3%. The strong performance of Eurus can be primarily attributed to UltraInteract, our newly-curated large-scale, high-quality alignment dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. UltraInteract can be used in both supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. For each instruction, it includes a preference tree consisting of (1) reasoning chains with diverse planning strategies in a unified format, (2) multi-turn interaction trajectories with the environment and the critique, and (3) pairwise data to facilitate preference learning. UltraInteract allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective which, together with UltraInteract, leads to a strong reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Models and data are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/Eurus</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating the Reasoning Behavior of Large Language Models -- A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01869v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive performance on tasks involving reasoning, leading to a lively debate on whether these models possess reasoning capabilities similar to humans. However, despite these successes, the depth of LLMs' reasoning abilities remains uncertain. This uncertainty partly stems from the predominant focus on task performance, measured through shallow accuracy metrics, rather than a thorough investigation of the models' reasoning behavior. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of studies that go beyond task accuracy, offering deeper insights into the models' reasoning processes. Furthermore, we survey prevalent methodologies to evaluate the reasoning behavior of LLMs, emphasizing current trends and efforts towards more nuanced reasoning analyses. Our review suggests that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level patterns and correlations in their training data, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities. Additionally, we identify the need for further research that delineates the key differences between human and LLM-based reasoning. Through this survey, we aim to shed light on the complex reasoning processes within LLMs.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |

Existing LLM leaderboards often reference scores reported in other papers without consistent settings and prompts, which may inadvertently encourage cherry-picking favored settings and prompts for better results. In this work, we introduce GPT-Fathom, an open-source and reproducible LLM evaluation suite built on top of OpenAI Evals. We systematically evaluate 10+ leading LLMs as well as OpenAI's legacy models on 20+ curated benchmarks across 7 capability categories, all under aligned settings. Our retrospective study on OpenAI's earlier models offers valuable insights into the evolutionary path from GPT-3 to GPT-4. Currently, the community is eager to know how GPT-3 progressively improves to GPT-4, including technical details like whether adding code data improves LLM's reasoning capability, which aspects of LLM capability can be improved by SFT and RLHF, how much is the alignment tax, etc. Our analysis sheds light on many of these questions, aiming to improve the transparency of advanced LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2024</p></details> |

Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01461v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17076v3)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs.

However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning.

However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations. Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones. To address such issues, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently. In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs. To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors. To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent. It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant efforts invested in improving prefix prompts or reasoning process, the crucial role of problem context might have been neglected. Accurate recognition of inputs is fundamental for solving mathematical tasks, as ill-formed problems could potentially mislead LLM's reasoning. In this study, we propose a new approach named Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to enhance the mathematical capacities of LLMs. Specifically, PEP decomposes and elucidates the problem context before reasoning, therefore enhancing the context modeling and parsing efficiency. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate promising performances: (1) PEP demonstrates an overall enhancement in various mathematical tasks. For instance, with the GPT-3.5 model, PEP exhibits improvements of 9.93% and 8.80% on GSM8k through greedy decoding and self-consistency, respectively. (2) PEP can be easily implemented and integrated with other prompting methods. (3) PEP shows particular strength in handling distraction problems.</p></details> |  |

The ability to explain and control an LLM's reasoning process is key for reliability, transparency, and future model developments. We propose SelfIE (Self-Interpretation of Embeddings), a framework that enables LLMs to interpret their own embeddings in natural language by leveraging their ability to respond to inquiries about a given passage. Capable of interpreting open-world concepts in the hidden embeddings, SelfIE reveals LLM internal reasoning in cases such as making ethical decisions, internalizing prompt injection, and recalling harmful knowledge. SelfIE's text descriptions on hidden embeddings also open up new avenues to control LLM reasoning. We propose Supervised Control, which allows editing open-ended concepts while only requiring gradient computation of individual layer. We extend RLHF to hidden embeddings and propose Reinforcement Control that erases harmful knowledge in LLM without supervision targets.</p></details> |  |

Vulnerability detection is of crucial importance to maintaining the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of software systems. Precise vulnerability detection requires reasoning about the code, making it a good case study for exploring the limits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Although recent work has applied LLMs to vulnerability detection using generic prompting techniques, their full capabilities for this task and the types of errors they make when explaining identified vulnerabilities remain unclear. In this paper, we surveyed eleven LLMs that are state-of-the-art in code generation and commonly used as coding assistants, and evaluated their capabilities for vulnerability detection. We systematically searched for the best-performing prompts, incorporating techniques such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought, and proposed three of our own prompting methods. Our results show that while our prompting methods improved the models' performance, LLMs generally struggled with vulnerability detection. They reported 0.5-0.63 Balanced Accuracy and failed to distinguish between buggy and fixed versions of programs in 76% of cases on average. By comprehensively analyzing and categorizing 287 instances of model reasoning, we found that 57% of LLM responses contained errors, and the models frequently predicted incorrect locations of buggy code and misidentified bug types. LLMs only correctly localized 6 out of 27 bugs in DbgBench, and these 6 bugs were predicted correctly by 70-100% of human participants. These findings suggest that despite their potential for other tasks, LLMs may fail to properly comprehend critical code structures and security-related concepts.

These issues could be partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm ``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Zero-Shot Prompting for Efficient Language Model Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15886v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach for efficiently distilling LLMs into smaller, application-specific models, significantly reducing operational costs and manual labor. Addressing the challenge of deploying computationally intensive LLMs in specific applications or edge devices, this technique utilizes LLMs' reasoning capabilities to generate labels and natural language rationales for unlabeled data. Our approach enhances both finetuning and distillation by employing a multi-task training framework where student models mimic these rationales alongside teacher predictions. Key contributions include the employment of zero-shot prompting to elicit teacher model rationales, reducing the necessity for handcrafted few-shot examples and lowering the overall token count required, which directly translates to cost savings given the pay-per-token billing model of major tech companies' LLM APIs. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of explanation properties on distillation efficiency, demonstrating that minimal performance loss occurs even when rationale augmentation is not applied across the entire dataset, facilitating further reductions of tokens. This research marks a step toward the efficient training of task-specific models with minimal human intervention, offering substantial cost-savings while maintaining, or even enhancing, performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like question-answering, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a minimalist qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. Instead of training data, SphNN uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to guide transformations from the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch by constructing sphere configurations as Euler diagrams, with the worst computational complexity of O(N^2). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing cognitive distortions from the interviewee's utterances can be an essential part of psychotherapy, especially for cognitive behavioral therapy. In this paper, we propose ERD, which improves LLM-based cognitive distortion classification performance with the aid of additional modules of (1) extracting the parts related to cognitive distortion, and (2) debating the reasoning steps by multiple agents. Our experimental results on a public dataset show that ERD improves the multi-class F1 score as well as binary specificity score. Regarding the latter score, it turns out that our method is effective in debiasing the baseline method which has high false positive rate, especially when the summary of multi-agent debate is provided to LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields. We will release CHARM at https://github.com/opendatalab/CHARM .</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Jiaxing Sun, Weiquan Huang, Jiang Wu; Corresponding author: Conghui He</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Code Generation Performance of Smaller Models by Distilling the Reasoning Ability of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13271v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant advances in code generation through the 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting technique. This technique empowers the model to autonomously devise "solution plans" to tackle intricate programming challenges, thereby improving its performance in code generation. Nevertheless, smaller models have been struggling to keep up with LLMs in deducing these plans, adversely affecting their code generation capabilities. Given the considerable size and associated deployment costs, along with concerns about data security, many teams opt for deploying smaller models for code generation. Consequently, there arises a compelling need for transferring LLMs' code generation reasoning abilities to the smaller models. In this paper, we propose the CodePLAN framework, which aims to transfer LLMs' reasoning capabilities to smaller models through distillation. We adopt a multi-task learning approach, jointly undertaking code generation and solution plan generation tasks, to enhance the code generation capabilities of the smaller model. To ensure the superior quality of the solution plans, we advocate for the utilization of backward reasoning and plan sampling strategies. Our experiments show that in comparison to the conventional fine-tuning approach, our approach improves the smaller model's code generation performance (measured in pass@1 metric) by over 130% on the challenging APPS benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Despite this progress, LLMs are still inadequate at social-cognitive reasoning, which humans are naturally good at. Drawing inspiration from psychological research on the links between certain personality traits and Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning, and from prompt engineering research on the hyper-sensitivity of prompts in affecting LLMs capabilities, this study investigates how inducing personalities in LLMs using prompts affects their ToM reasoning capabilities. Our findings show that certain induced personalities can significantly affect the LLMs' reasoning capabilities in three different ToM tasks. In particular, traits from the Dark Triad have a larger variable effect on LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Mistral across the different ToM tasks. We find that LLMs that exhibit a higher variance across personality prompts in ToM also tends to be more controllable in personality tests: personality traits in LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2 and Mistral can be controllably adjusted through our personality prompts. In today's landscape where role-play is a common strategy when using LLMs, our research highlights the need for caution, as models that adopt specific personas with personalities potentially also alter their reasoning abilities in an unexpected manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvGen: Generating and Adapting Environments via LLMs for Training Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12014v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent SOTA approaches for embodied learning via interaction directly employ large language models (LLMs) as agents to determine the next steps in an environment. Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. Instead of directly employing LLMs as agents, can we use LLMs' reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? We propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an LLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn different tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description and simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items given to agents, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agent's performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We show qualitatively how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL agents' weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require thousands of LLM calls. Lastly, we present detailed ablation studies for our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally; Project website: https://envgen-llm.github.io/</p></details> |

The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity, addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better Zero-Shot Reasoning with Role-Play Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07702v2)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for role-playing, enabling them to embody not only human characters but also non-human entities. This versatility allows them to simulate complex human-like interactions and behaviors within various contexts, as well as to emulate specific objects or systems. While these capabilities have enhanced user engagement and introduced novel modes of interaction, the influence of role-playing on LLMs' reasoning abilities remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a strategically designed role-play prompting methodology and assess its performance under the zero-shot setting across twelve diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results illustrate that role-play prompting consistently surpasses the standard zero-shot approach across most datasets. Notably, in experiments conducted using ChatGPT, accuracy on AQuA rises from 53.5% to 63.8%, and on Last Letter from 23.8% to 84.2%.Upon further comparison with the Zero-Shot-CoT technique, which prompts the model to "think step by step", our study demonstrates that role-play prompting acts as a more effective trigger for the CoT process. This highlights its potential to augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We release our code at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Role-Play-Prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024, Main Conference</p></details> |

We compared human and large language model (LLM) performance on a new child-friendly set of ARC items. Results show that both children and adults outperform most LLMs on these tasks. Error analysis revealed a similar "fallback" solution strategy in LLMs and young children, where part of the analogy is simply copied. In addition, we found two other error types, one based on seemingly grasping key concepts (e.g., Inside-Outside) and the other based on simple combinations of analogy input matrices. On the whole, "concept" errors were more common in humans, and "matrix" errors were more common in LLMs. This study sheds new light on LLM reasoning ability and the extent to which we can use error analyses and comparisons with human development to understand how LLMs solve visual analogies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-aware Alert Aggregation in Large-scale Cloud Systems: a Hybrid Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06485v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scale and complexity of cloud systems, a system failure would trigger an "alert storm", i.e., massive correlated alerts. Although these alerts can be traced back to a few root causes, the overwhelming number makes it infeasible for manual handling. Alert aggregation is thus critical to help engineers concentrate on the root cause and facilitate failure resolution. Existing methods typically utilize semantic similarity-based methods or statistical methods to aggregate alerts. However, semantic similarity-based methods overlook the causal rationale of alerts, while statistical methods can hardly handle infrequent alerts. To tackle these limitations, we introduce leveraging external knowledge, i.e., Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of alerts as a supplement. We propose COLA, a novel hybrid approach based on correlation mining and LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning for online alert aggregation. The correlation mining module effectively captures the temporal and spatial relations between alerts, measuring their correlations in an efficient manner. Subsequently, only uncertain pairs with low confidence are forwarded to the LLM reasoning module for detailed analysis. This hybrid design harnesses both statistical evidence for frequent alerts and the reasoning capabilities of computationally intensive LLMs, ensuring the overall efficiency of COLA in handling large volumes of alerts in practical scenarios. We evaluate COLA on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform. The experimental results show COLA achieves F1-scores from 0.901 to 0.930, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable efficiency. We also share our experience in deploying COLA in our real-world cloud system, Cloud X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Proceedings of the 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE SEIP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[CoRAL: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Improve Long-tail Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06447v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-tail recommendation is a challenging task for traditional recommender systems, due to data sparsity and data imbalance issues. The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has shown their abilities in complex reasoning, which can help to deduce users' preferences based on very few previous interactions. However, since most LLM-based systems rely on items' semantic meaning as the sole evidence for reasoning, the collaborative information of user-item interactions is neglected, which can cause the LLM's reasoning to be misaligned with task-specific collaborative information of the dataset. To further align LLMs' reasoning to task-specific user-item interaction knowledge, we introduce collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, CoRAL, which directly incorporate collaborative evidence into the prompts. Based on the retrieved user-item interactions, the LLM can analyze shared and distinct preferences among users, and summarize the patterns indicating which types of users would be attracted by certain items. The retrieved collaborative evidence prompts the LLM to align its reasoning with the user-item interaction patterns in the dataset. However, since the capacity of the input prompt is limited, finding the minimally-sufficient collaborative information for recommendation tasks can be challenging. We propose to find the optimal interaction set through a sequential decision-making process and develop a retrieval policy learned through a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, CoRAL. Our experimental results show that CoRAL can significantly improve LLMs' reasoning abilities on specific recommendation tasks. Our analysis also reveals that CoRAL can more efficiently explore collaborative information through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 11 pages |

It has tremendous significance in real-world applications since an average layperson does not excel at differentiating species of birds or mushrooms due to subtle differences among the species. A major bottleneck in developing FGVR systems is caused by the need of high-quality paired expert annotations. To circumvent the need of expert knowledge we propose Fine-grained Semantic Category Reasoning (FineR) that internally leverages the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) as a proxy in order to reason about fine-grained category names. In detail, to bridge the modality gap between images and LLM, we extract part-level visual attributes from images as text and feed that information to a LLM. Based on the visual attributes and its internal world knowledge the LLM reasons about the subordinate-level category names. Our training-free FineR outperforms several state-of-the-art FGVR and language and vision assistant models and shows promise in working in the wild and in new domains where gathering expert annotation is arduous.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2024; Project page: https://projfiner.github.io/</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of RLHF, we study the performance of multiple algorithms that learn from feedback (Expert Iteration, Proximal Policy Optimization (\textbf{PPO}), Return-Conditioned RL) on improving LLM reasoning capabilities. We investigate both sparse and dense rewards provided to the LLM both heuristically and via a learned reward model. We additionally start from multiple model sizes and initializations both with and without supervised fine-tuning (\textbf{SFT}) data. Overall, we find all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases. Surprisingly, we find the sample complexity of Expert Iteration is similar to that of PPO, requiring at most on the order of $10^6$ samples to converge from a pretrained checkpoint. We investigate why this is the case, concluding that during RL training models fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models. Additionally, we discuss a trade off between maj@1 and pass@96 metric performance during SFT training and how conversely RL training improves both simultaneously. We then conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for RLHF and the future role of RL in LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, domain-specific fine-tuning of embedding models significantly improves performance within cybersecurity contexts, underscoring the efficacy of our methodology.

Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2 facilitates a "bidirectional" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating its potential to enable "bidirectional" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate Re2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal Re2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies.

| **[Beyond Natural Language: LLMs Leveraging Alternative Formats for Enhanced Reasoning and Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18439v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.

By comparing the implied SCM with that of human reasoning, we highlight discrepancies between LLM and human reasoning processes. We further examine the factors influencing the causal structure of the implied SCM, revealing that in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning on human feedback significantly impact the causal relations.

However, the progress in the field of graph reasoning with LLM remains limited. Our work delves into this gap by thoroughly investigating graph reasoning with LLMs. In this work, we reveal the impact of the order of graph description on LLMs' graph reasoning performance, which significantly affects LLMs' reasoning abilities. By altering this order, we enhance the performance of LLMs from 42.22\% to 70\%. Furthermore, we introduce the Scaled Graph Reasoning benchmark for assessing LLMs' performance across various graph sizes and evaluate the relationship between LLMs' graph reasoning abilities and graph size. We discover that the graph reasoning performance of LLMs does not monotonically decrease with the increase in graph size. The experiments span several mainstream models, including GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-2-13B, to offer a comprehensive evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, considering that stance detection usually requires detailed background knowledge, the vanilla reasoning method may neglect the domain knowledge to make a professional and accurate analysis. Thus, there is still room for improvement of LLMs reasoning, especially in leveraging the generation capability of LLMs to simulate specific experts (i.e., multi-agents) to detect the stance. In this paper, different from existing multi-agent works that require detailed descriptions and use fixed experts, we propose a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) method which can leverage the generated experienced experts and let LLMs reason in a semi-parametric way, making the experts more generalizable and reliable. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEM consistently achieves the best results on three standard benchmarks, outperforms methods with self-consistency reasoning, and reduces the bias of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multiagent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning -- both individually and as a team -- surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH.

In contrast to previous approaches that relied on smaller amateur models or analysis of hidden state differences, DCD employs Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting and advanced distillation techniques, including Dropout and Quantization. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of Contrastive Decoding (CD), which typically requires both an expert and an amateur model, thus increasing computational resource demands. By integrating contrastive prompts with distillation, DCD obviates the need for an amateur model and reduces memory usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that DCD significantly enhances LLM performance across a range of reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both CD and existing methods in the GSM8K and StrategyQA datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models in Coding Through Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17272v2)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in code generation. However, generating the correct solution in a single attempt still remains a challenge. Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph. MPSC significantly boosts performance of foundation models (ChatGPT in this paper) on various benchmarks, including HumanEval (+15.91%), MBPP (+6.43%) and CodeContests (+9.37%), even surpassing GPT-4.</p></details> | Preprint version |

This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages; the first two authors contributed equally; GTBench HF Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/GTBench/GTBench</p></details> |

This process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, can enhance self-consistency, interpretability, and tasks such as medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on a total of four commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We find that the strategy of PoE always underperforms the strategy of choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct error analyses and give suggestions for future work.</p></details> | In progress preprint |

Despite LLMs advancements in recent times, their performance consistency across different input lengths is not well understood. We investigate this aspect by introducing a novel QA reasoning framework, specifically designed to assess the impact of input length. We isolate the effect of input length using multiple versions of the same sample, each being extended with padding of different lengths, types and locations. Our findings show a notable degradation in LLMs' reasoning performance at much shorter input lengths than their technical maximum. We show that the degradation trend appears in every version of our dataset, although at different intensities. Additionally, our study reveals that traditional perplexity metrics do not correlate with performance of LLMs' in long input reasoning tasks. We analyse our results and identify failure modes that can serve as useful guides for future research, potentially informing strategies to address the limitations observed in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-driven Meta-structure Discovery in Heterogeneous Information Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11518v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous information networks (HIN) have gained increasing popularity for being able to capture complex relations between nodes of diverse types. Meta-structure was proposed to identify important patterns of relations on HIN, which has been proven effective for extracting rich semantic information and facilitating graph neural networks to learn expressive representations. However, hand-crafted meta-structures pose challenges for scaling up, which draws wide research attention for developing automatic meta-structure search algorithms. Previous efforts concentrate on searching for meta-structures with good empirical prediction performance, overlooking explainability. Thus, they often produce meta-structures prone to overfitting and incomprehensible to humans. To address this, we draw inspiration from the emergent reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose a novel REasoning meta-STRUCTure search (ReStruct) framework that integrates LLM reasoning into the evolutionary procedure. ReStruct uses a grammar translator to encode meta-structures into natural language sentences, and leverages the reasoning power of LLMs to evaluate semantically feasible meta-structures. ReStruct also employs performance-oriented evolutionary operations. These two competing forces jointly optimize for semantic explainability and empirical performance of meta-structures. We also design a differential LLM explainer that can produce natural language explanations for the discovered meta-structures, and refine the explanation by reasoning through the search history. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate ReStruct achieve SOTA performance in node classification and link recommendation tasks. Additionally, a survey study involving 73 graduate students shows that the meta-structures and natural language explanations generated by ReStruct are substantially more comprehensible.</p></details> |  |

Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex and abstract conclusions and premises, and improve various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rule and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities~\footnote{Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/ULogic}.}.</p></details> |  |

However, previous table reasoning solutions only consider small-sized tables and exhibit limitations in handling larger tables. In addition, most existing methods struggle to reason over complex questions since they lack essential information or they are scattered in different places. To alleviate these challenges, we propose TAP4LLM as a versatile pre-processing toolbox to generate table prompts through (1) table sampling, (2) table augmentation, and (3) table packing while balancing the token allocation trade-off. In each module, we collect and design several common methods for usage in various scenarios (e.g., speed over accuracy). We also provide a comprehensive evaluation on performance of each components inside TAP4LLM and show that our method improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities in various tabular tasks and enhances the interaction between LLMs and tabular data by employing effective pre-processing.</p></details> |  |

However, Existing large language models'(LLMs) reasoning ability in multi-hop question answering remains exploration, which is inadequate in answering multi-hop questions. Moreover, it is unclear whether LLMs follow a desired reasoning chain to reach the right final answer. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{gen}erative question \textbf{dec}omposition method (GenDec) from the perspective of explainable QA by generating independent and complete sub-questions based on incorporating additional extracted evidence for enhancing LLMs' reasoning ability in RAG. To demonstrate the impact, generalization, and robustness of Gendec, we conduct two experiments, the first is combining GenDec with small QA systems on paragraph retrieval and QA tasks. We secondly examine the reasoning capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 combined with GenDec. We experiment on the HotpotQA, 2WikihopMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and PokeMQA datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Generating Human Mobility from Context-aware Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09836v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility behaviours are closely linked to various important societal problems such as traffic congestion, and epidemic control. However, collecting mobility data can be prohibitively expensive and involves serious privacy issues, posing a pressing need for high-quality generative mobility models. Previous efforts focus on learning the behaviour distribution from training samples, and generate new mobility data by sampling the learned distributions. They cannot effectively capture the coherent intentions that drive mobility behavior, leading to low sample efficiency and semantic-awareness. Inspired by the emergent reasoning ability in LLMs, we propose a radical perspective shift that reformulates mobility generation as a commonsense reasoning problem. In this paper, we design a novel Mobility Generation as Reasoning (MobiGeaR) framework that prompts LLM to recursively generate mobility behaviour. Specifically, we design a context-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting technique to align LLMs with context-aware mobility behaviour by few-shot in-context learning. Besides, MobiGeaR employ a divide-and-coordinate mechanism to exploit the synergistic effect between LLM reasoning and mechanistic gravity model. It leverages the step-by-step LLM reasoning to recursively generate a temporal template of activity intentions, which are then mapped to physical locations with a mechanistic gravity model. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MobiGeaR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and substantially reduces the size of training samples at the same time. Besides, MobiGeaR also significantly improves the semantic-awareness of mobility generation by improving the intention accuracy by 62.23% and the generated mobility data is proven effective in boosting the performance of downstream applications. The implementation of our approach is available in the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fewer is More: Boosting LLM Reasoning with Reinforced Context Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08901v3)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet they still struggle with math reasoning. In this work, we propose CoT-Influx, a novel approach that pushes the boundary of few-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) learning to improve LLM mathematical reasoning. Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. A math reasoning dataset with diverse difficulty levels and reasoning steps is used to train the pruner, along with a math-specialized reinforcement learning approach. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Influx surpasses GPT-3.5 and a wide range of larger LLMs (PaLM, Minerva 540B, etc.) on the GSM8K. CoT-Influx serves as a plug-and-play module for LLMs and is compatible with most existing reasoning prompting techniques, such as self-consistency and self-verification.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include an innovative document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.</p></details> |  |

However, recent work demonstrates that even the best models struggle to identify \textit{when and where to refine} without access to external feedback. Outcome-based Reward Models (\textbf{ORMs}), trained to predict correctness of the final answer indicating when to refine, offer one convenient solution for deciding when to refine. Process Based Reward Models (\textbf{PRMs}), trained to predict correctness of intermediate steps, can then be used to indicate where to refine. But they are expensive to train, requiring extensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose Stepwise ORMs (\textbf{SORMs}) which are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of the optimal policy or $V^{\star}$. More specifically, SORMs are trained to predict the correctness of the final answer when sampling the current policy many times (rather than only once as in the case of ORMs). Our experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps compared to ORMs, thus improving downstream accuracy when doing refinements. We then train \textit{global} refinement models, which take only the question and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and \textit{local} refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements, using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually, as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53\% to 65\% when greedily sampled.</p></details> |  |

We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, KDD Preprint</p></details> |

To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687v4)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.</p></details> |  |

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of LLMs in executing real-time strategy war tasks within the StarCraft II gaming environment. In this paper, we introduce SwarmBrain, an embodied agent leveraging LLM for real-time strategy implementation in the StarCraft II game environment. The SwarmBrain comprises two key components: 1) a Overmind Intelligence Matrix, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, is designed to orchestrate macro-level strategies from a high-level perspective. This matrix emulates the overarching consciousness of the Zerg intelligence brain, synthesizing strategic foresight with the aim of allocating resources, directing expansion, and coordinating multi-pronged assaults. 2) a Swarm ReflexNet, which is agile counterpart to the calculated deliberation of the Overmind Intelligence Matrix. Due to the inherent latency in LLM reasoning, the Swarm ReflexNet employs a condition-response state machine framework, enabling expedited tactical responses for fundamental Zerg unit maneuvers. In the experimental setup, SwarmBrain is in control of the Zerg race in confrontation with an Computer-controlled Terran adversary. Experimental results show the capacity of SwarmBrain to conduct economic augmentation, territorial expansion, and tactical formulation, and it shows the SwarmBrain is capable of achieving victory against Computer players set at different difficulty levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recommender Systems with Large Language Model Reasoning Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10835v2)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems aim to provide users with relevant suggestions, but often lack interpretability and fail to capture higher-level semantic relationships between user behaviors and profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct personalized reasoning graphs. These graphs link a user's profile and behavioral sequences through causal and logical inferences, representing the user's interests in an interpretable way. Our approach, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG), has four components: chained graph reasoning, divergent extension, self-verification and scoring, and knowledge base self-improvement. The resulting reasoning graph is encoded using graph neural networks, which serves as additional input to improve conventional recommender systems, without requiring extra user or item information. Our approach demonstrates how LLMs can enable more logical and interpretable recommender systems through personalized reasoning graphs. LLMRG allows recommendations to benefit from both engineered recommendation systems and LLM-derived reasoning graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMRG on benchmarks and real-world scenarios in enhancing base recommendation models.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04925v3)** | 2024-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SocraSynth, a multi-LLM agent reasoning platform developed to mitigate these issues. SocraSynth utilizes conditional statistics and systematic context enhancement through continuous arguments, alongside adjustable debate contentiousness levels. The platform typically involves a human moderator and two LLM agents representing opposing viewpoints on a given subject. SocraSynth operates in two main phases: knowledge generation and reasoning evaluation. In the knowledge generation phase, the moderator defines the debate topic and contentiousness level, prompting the agents to formulate supporting arguments for their respective stances. The reasoning evaluation phase then employs Socratic reasoning and formal logic principles to appraise the quality of the arguments presented. The dialogue concludes with the moderator adjusting the contentiousness from confrontational to collaborative, gathering final, conciliatory remarks to aid in human reasoning and decision-making. Through case studies in three distinct application domains, this paper showcases SocraSynth's effectiveness in fostering rigorous research, dynamic reasoning, comprehensive assessment, and enhanced collaboration. This underscores the value of multi-agent interactions in leveraging LLMs for advanced knowledge extraction and decision-making support.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 fig...</summary><p>1 figure, 6 tables, 6 appendices</p></details> |

Especially in scenarios that require long logical chains or complex reasoning, the hallucination and knowledge limitation of LLM limit its performance in question answering (QA). In this paper, we propose a novel framework KnowledgeNavigator to address these challenges by efficiently and accurately retrieving external knowledge from knowledge graph and using it as a key factor to enhance LLM reasoning. Specifically, KnowledgeNavigator first mines and enhances the potential constraints of the given question to guide the reasoning. Then it retrieves and filters external knowledge that supports answering through iterative reasoning on knowledge graph with the guidance of LLM and the question. Finally, KnowledgeNavigator constructs the structured knowledge into effective prompts that are friendly to LLM to help its reasoning. We evaluate KnowledgeNavigator on multiple public KGQA benchmarks, the experiments show the framework has great effectiveness and generalization, outperforming previous knowledge graph enhanced LLM methods and is comparable to the fully supervised models.</p></details> |  |

Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The First International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (ICSE 2024)</p></details> |

Turbulence consists of a large set of natural language $\textit{question templates}$, each of which is a programming problem, parameterised so that it can be asked in many different forms. Each question template has an associated $\textit{test oracle}$ that judges whether a code solution returned by an LLM is correct. Thus, from a single question template, it is possible to ask an LLM a $\textit{neighbourhood}$ of very similar programming questions, and assess the correctness of the result returned for each question. This allows gaps in an LLM's code generation abilities to be identified, including $\textit{anomalies}$ where the LLM correctly solves $\textit{almost all}$ questions in a neighbourhood but fails for particular parameter instantiations. We present experiments against five LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere and Meta, each at two temperature configurations. Our findings show that, across the board, Turbulence is able to reveal gaps in LLM reasoning ability. This goes beyond merely highlighting that LLMs sometimes produce wrong code (which is no surprise): by systematically identifying cases where LLMs are able to solve some problems in a neighbourhood but do not manage to generalise to solve the whole neighbourhood, our method is effective at highlighting $\textit{robustness}$ issues. We present data and examples that shed light on the kinds of mistakes that LLMs make when they return incorrect code results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified a typo in the conclusion section regarding the impact of temperature reduction on the diversity of errors</p></details> |
| **[A & B == B & A: Triggering Logical Reasoning Failures in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00757v1)** | 2024-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation. A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason." However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes. Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope. In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic. The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well. We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%. In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4. As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively. All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p></details> |  |

Previous works, such as Alphastar and SCC, achieve impressive performance on tackling StarCraft II , however, still exhibit deficiencies in long term strategic planning and strategy interpretability. Emerging large language model (LLM) agents, such as Voyage and MetaGPT, presents the immense potential in solving intricate tasks. Motivated by this, we aim to validate the capabilities of LLMs on StarCraft II, a highly complex RTS game.To conveniently take full advantage of LLMs` reasoning abilities, we first develop textual StratCraft II environment, called TextStarCraft II, which LLM agent can interact. Secondly, we propose a Chain of Summarization method, including single frame summarization for processing raw observations and multi frame summarization for analyzing game information, providing command recommendations, and generating strategic decisions. Our experiment consists of two parts: first, an evaluation by human experts, which includes assessing the LLMs`s mastery of StarCraft II knowledge and the performance of LLM agents in the game; second, the in game performance of LLM agents, encompassing aspects like win rate and the impact of Chain of Summarization.Experiment results demonstrate that: 1. LLMs possess the relevant knowledge and complex planning abilities needed to address StarCraft II scenarios; 2. Human experts consider the performance of LLM agents to be close to that of an average player who has played StarCraft II for eight years; 3. LLM agents are capable of defeating the built in AI at the Harder(Lv5) difficulty level. We have open sourced the code and released demo videos of LLM agent playing StarCraft II.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexities of sequential recommendation, such as sequential patterns across datasets, noise within sequences, and the temporal evolution of user preferences, existing LLM reasoning strategies, such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought are not fully effective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reasoning principle: Dynamic Reflection with Divergent Thinking within a retriever-reranker framework. Our approach starts with a collaborative in-context demonstration retriever, which collects sequences exhibiting collaborative behaviors as in-context examples. Following this, we abstract high-level user preferences across multiple aspects, providing a more nuanced understanding of user interests and circumventing the noise within the raw sequences. The cornerstone of our methodology is dynamic reflection, a process that emulates human learning through probing, critiquing, and reflecting, using user feedback to tailor the analysis more effectively to the target user in a temporal manner. We evaluate our approach on three datasets using six pre-trained LLMs. The superior performance observed across these models demonstrates the efficacy of our reasoning strategy, notably achieved without the need to fine-tune the LLMs. With our principle, we managed to outperform GPT-Turbo-3.5 on three datasets using 7b models e.g., Vicuna-7b and Openchat-7b on NDCG@10. This research not only highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing sequential recommendation systems but also underscores the importance of developing tailored reasoning strategies to fully harness their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models to Facilitate Legal Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13095v1)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language serves as a vehicle for conveying thought, enabling communication among individuals. The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts, identify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions fundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in logical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation methodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute to the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks while acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic.</p></details> | ALP@JURIX2023 |
| **[Think Twice: Perspective-Taking Improves Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10227v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human interactions are deeply rooted in the interplay of thoughts, beliefs, and desires made possible by Theory of Mind (ToM): our cognitive ability to understand the mental states of ourselves and others. Although ToM may come naturally to us, emulating it presents a challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent improvements to LLMs' reasoning capabilities from simple yet effective prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought have seen limited applicability to ToM. In this paper, we turn to the prominent cognitive science theory "Simulation Theory" to bridge this gap. We introduce SimToM, a novel two-stage prompting framework inspired by Simulation Theory's notion of perspective-taking. To implement this idea on current ToM benchmarks, SimToM first filters context based on what the character in question knows before answering a question about their mental state. Our approach, which requires no additional training and minimal prompt-tuning, shows substantial improvement over existing methods, and our analysis reveals the importance of perspective-taking to Theory-of-Mind capabilities. Our findings suggest perspective-taking as a promising direction for future research into improving LLMs' ToM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models can Solve Computer Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17491v3)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents capable of carrying out general tasks on a computer can improve efficiency and productivity by automating repetitive tasks and assisting in complex problem-solving. Ideally, such agents should be able to solve new computer tasks presented to them through natural language commands. However, previous approaches to this problem require large amounts of expert demonstrations and task-specific reward functions, both of which are impractical for new tasks. In this work, we show that a pre-trained large language model (LLM) agent can execute computer tasks guided by natural language using a simple prompting scheme where the agent Recursively Criticizes and Improves its output (RCI). The RCI approach significantly outperforms existing LLM methods for automating computer tasks and surpasses supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on the MiniWoB++ benchmark. We compare multiple LLMs and find that RCI with the InstructGPT-3+RLHF LLM is state-of-the-art on MiniWoB++, using only a handful of demonstrations per task rather than tens of thousands, and without a task-specific reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate RCI prompting's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities on a suite of natural language reasoning tasks, outperforming chain of thought (CoT) prompting with external feedback. We find that RCI combined with CoT performs better than either separately. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/posgnu/rci-agent.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable performance, understanding their decision-making process remains a big challenge. In this paper, we look into bringing some transparency to this process by introducing a new explanation dataset for question answering (QA) tasks that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) in a novel way. Our dataset includes 12,102 question-answer-explanation (QAE) triples. Each explanation in the dataset links the LLM's reasoning to entities and relations in the KGs. The explanation component includes a why-choose explanation, a why-not-choose explanation, and a set of reason-elements that underlie the LLM's decision. We leverage KGs and graph attention networks (GAT) to find the reason-elements and transform them into why-choose and why-not-choose explanations that are comprehensible to humans. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the potential of our dataset to improve the in-context learning of LLMs, and enhance their interpretability and explainability. Our work contributes to the field of explainable AI by enabling a deeper understanding of the LLMs decision-making process to make them more transparent and thereby, potentially more reliable, to researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[QualEval: Qualitative Evaluation for Model Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02807v1)** | 2023-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative evaluation metrics have traditionally been pivotal in gauging the advancements of artificial intelligence systems, including large language models (LLMs). However, these metrics have inherent limitations. Given the intricate nature of real-world tasks, a single scalar to quantify and compare is insufficient to capture the fine-grained nuances of model behavior. Metrics serve only as a way to compare and benchmark models, and do not yield actionable diagnostics, thus making the model improvement process challenging. Model developers find themselves amid extensive manual efforts involving sifting through vast datasets and attempting hit-or-miss adjustments to training data or setups. In this work, we address the shortcomings of quantitative metrics by proposing QualEval, which augments quantitative scalar metrics with automated qualitative evaluation as a vehicle for model improvement. QualEval uses a powerful LLM reasoner and our novel flexible linear programming solver to generate human-readable insights that when applied, accelerate model improvement. The insights are backed by a comprehensive dashboard with fine-grained visualizations and human-interpretable analyses. We corroborate the faithfulness of QualEval by demonstrating that leveraging its insights, for example, improves the absolute performance of the Llama 2 model by up to 15% points relative on a challenging dialogue task (DialogSum) when compared to baselines. QualEval successfully increases the pace of model development, thus in essence serving as a data-scientist-in-a-box. Given the focus on critiquing and improving current evaluation metrics, our method serves as a refreshingly new technique for both model evaluation and improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hint-enhanced In-Context Learning wakes Large Language Models up for knowledge-intensive tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01949v1)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) ability has emerged with the increasing scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to learn input-label mappings from demonstrations and perform well on downstream tasks. However, under the standard ICL setting, LLMs may sometimes neglect query-related information in demonstrations, leading to incorrect predictions. To address this limitation, we propose a new paradigm called Hint-enhanced In-Context Learning (HICL) to explore the power of ICL in open-domain question answering, an important form in knowledge-intensive tasks. HICL leverages LLMs' reasoning ability to extract query-related knowledge from demonstrations, then concatenates the knowledge to prompt LLMs in a more explicit way. Furthermore, we track the source of this knowledge to identify specific examples, and introduce a Hint-related Example Retriever (HER) to select informative examples for enhanced demonstrations. We evaluate HICL with HER on 3 open-domain QA benchmarks, and observe average performance gains of 2.89 EM score and 2.52 F1 score on gpt-3.5-turbo, 7.62 EM score and 7.27 F1 score on LLaMA-2-Chat-7B compared with standard setting.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance on text-to-SQL parsing still has much room for improvement. In this paper, we hypothesize that a crucial aspect of LLMs to improve for text-to-SQL parsing is their multi-step reasoning ability. Thus, we systematically study how to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability through chain of thought (CoT) style prompting, including the original chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2023). Our experiments demonstrate that iterative prompting as in Zhou et al. (2023) may be unnecessary for text-to-SQL parsing, and using detailed reasoning steps tends to have more error propagation issues. Based on these findings, we propose a new CoT-style prompting method for text-to-SQL parsing. It brings 5.2 and 6.5 point absolute gains on the Spider development set and the Spider Realistic set, respectively, compared to the standard prompting method without reasoning steps; 2.4 and 1.5 point absolute gains, compared to the least-to-most prompting method.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023 main; long paper</p></details> |

We study the problem of prompt designing in the text-to-SQL task and attempt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability when generating SQL queries. Besides the trivial few-shot in-context learning setting, we design our chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt with a similar method to schema linking. We provide a method named ACT-SQL to automatically generate auto-CoT exemplars and thus the whole process doesn't need manual labeling. Our approach is cost-saving since we only use the LLMs' API call once when generating one SQL query. Furthermore, we extend our in-context learning method to the multi-turn text-to-SQL task. The experiment results show that the LLMs' performance can benefit from our ACT-SQL approach. Our approach achieves SOTA performance on the Spider dev set among existing in-context learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the growth of the reasoning chain introduces uncertainty and error accumulation, making it challenging to elicit accurate final results. To tackle this challenge of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning, we introduce a stepwise self-evaluation mechanism to guide and calibrate the reasoning process of LLMs. We propose a decoding algorithm integrating the self-evaluation guidance via stochastic beam search. The self-evaluation guidance serves as a better-calibrated automatic criterion, facilitating an efficient search in the reasoning space and resulting in superior prediction quality. Stochastic beam search balances exploitation and exploration of the search space with temperature-controlled randomness. Our approach surpasses the corresponding Codex-backboned baselines in few-shot accuracy by $6.34\%$, $9.56\%$, and $5.46\%$ on the GSM8K, AQuA, and StrategyQA benchmarks, respectively. Experiment results with Llama-2 on arithmetic reasoning demonstrate the efficiency of our method in outperforming the baseline methods with comparable computational budgets. Further analysis in multi-step reasoning finds our self-evaluation guidance pinpoints logic failures and leads to higher consistency and robustness.

| **[Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992v2)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, CoT). However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal $\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework, $\underline{R}$easoning vi$\underline{a}$ $\underline{P}$lanning $\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration $\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. RAP on LLAMA-33B surpasses CoT on GPT-4 with 33% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023.

Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13160v2)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments. Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests more careful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs can improve their responses based on feedback.</p></details> | EMNLP-23 (findings) |

However, LLMs face challenges in maintaining factual consistency during reasoning, exhibiting tendencies to condition overlooking, question misinterpretation, and condition hallucination over given problems. Existing methods use coarse-grained feedback (e.g., whether the answer is correct) to improve factual consistency. In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing Chain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities by automatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs, generated solutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct the problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between the original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual inconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT formulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide LLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of RCoT over standard CoT, Self-Consistency and Self-Refine across seven arithmetic datasets. Moreover, we find that manually written fine-grained feedback can dramatically improve LLMs' reasoning abilities (e.g., ChatGPT reaches 94.6% accuracy on GSM8K), encouraging the community to further explore the fine-grained feedback generation methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 21 figures |

Inspired by the great success of code data in training LLMs, we naturally wonder at which training stage introducing code data can really help LLMs reasoning. To this end, this paper systematically explores the impact of code data on LLMs at different stages. Concretely, we introduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both of them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively and fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks in five domains. We critically analyze the experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training LLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the instruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capability. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to learn reasoning capability step-by-step during training. These insights deepen the understanding of LLMs regarding reasoning ability for their application, such as scientific question answering, legal support, etc. The source code and model parameters are released at the link:~\url{https://github.com/yingweima2022/CodeLLM}.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs' reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.</p></details> |  |

This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works, additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large margin.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the effect of code on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability by introducing different constraints on the \textit{Code Usage Frequency} of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. We found that its success can be largely attributed to its powerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code execution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective prompting method, explicit \uline{c}ode-based \uline{s}elf-\uline{v}erification~(CSV), to further boost the mathematical reasoning potential of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This method employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to use code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state registers as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution, analogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics examination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification result indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the effectiveness of majority voting. With GPT-4 Code Interpreter and CSV, we achieve an impressive zero-shot accuracy on MATH dataset \textbf{(53.9\% $\to$ 84.3\%)}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Solvi...</summary><p>Solving Challenging Math Word Problems Using GPT-4 Code Interpreter with Code-based Self-Verification</p></details> |
| **[GPT-4 Can't Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03762v2)** | 2023-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model, which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However, despite the genuinely impressive improvement, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical of GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP community, as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently evaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and performs a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4's performance on those problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that, despite its occasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly incapable of reasoning.</p></details> |  |

For example, users don't always get desirable answers for complex mathematical problems without human involvement. Against this background, we present the Manual Correction System (MCS) -- a human-in-the-loop system enhanced by Chain-of-Thought prompting, which explores how manual correction of sub-logics in rationales can improve LLM's reasoning performance. Moving one step forward, considering a system with human-in-the-loop involves more than having humans improve performance but also controlling the cost. Therefore, we post a Cost-utility Analysis Model for Human-in-the-Loop systems (CAMLOP) based on classical economics theory to analyze, quantify and balance the utility and the corresponding cost. We conduct experiments of MCS and CAMLOP with twelve datasets. A significant advantage w.r.t cost and utility proves its superiority over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Qualitative Research Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13298v1)** | 2023-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of AI driven large language models (LLMs) have stirred discussions about their role in qualitative research. Some view these as tools to enrich human understanding, while others perceive them as threats to the core values of the discipline. This study aimed to compare and contrast the comprehension capabilities of humans and LLMs. We conducted an experiment with small sample of Alexa app reviews, initially classified by a human analyst. LLMs were then asked to classify these reviews and provide the reasoning behind each classification. We compared the results with human classification and reasoning. The research indicated a significant alignment between human and ChatGPT 3.5 classifications in one third of cases, and a slightly lower alignment with GPT4 in over a quarter of cases. The two AI models showed a higher alignment, observed in more than half of the instances. However, a consensus across all three methods was seen only in about one fifth of the classifications. In the comparison of human and LLMs reasoning, it appears that human analysts lean heavily on their individual experiences. As expected, LLMs, on the other hand, base their reasoning on the specific word choices found in app reviews and the functional components of the app itself. Our results highlight the potential for effective human LLM collaboration, suggesting a synergistic rather than competitive relationship. Researchers must continuously evaluate LLMs role in their work, thereby fostering a future where AI and humans jointly enrich qualitative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TART: A plug-and-play Transformer module for task-agnostic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07536v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit in-context learning abilities which enable the same model to perform several tasks without any task-specific training. In contrast, traditional adaptation approaches, such as fine-tuning, modify the underlying models for each specific task. In-context learning, however, consistently underperforms task-specific tuning approaches even when presented with the same examples. While most existing approaches (e.g., prompt engineering) focus on the LLM's learned representations to patch this performance gap, our analysis actually reveal that LLM representations contain sufficient information to make good predictions. As such, we focus on the LLM's reasoning abilities and demonstrate that this performance gap exists due to their inability to perform simple probabilistic reasoning tasks. This raises an intriguing question: Are LLMs actually capable of learning how to reason in a task-agnostic manner? We answer this in the affirmative and propose TART which generically improves an LLM's reasoning abilities using a synthetically trained Transformer-based reasoning module. TART trains this reasoning module in a task-agnostic manner using only synthetic logistic regression tasks and composes it with an arbitrary real-world pre-trained model without any additional training. With a single inference module, TART improves performance across different model families (GPT-Neo, Pythia, BLOOM), model sizes (100M - 6B), tasks (14 NLP binary classification tasks), and even across different modalities (audio and vision). Additionally, on the RAFT Benchmark, TART improves GPT-Neo (125M)'s performance such that it outperforms BLOOM (176B), and is within 4% of GPT-3 (175B). Our code and models are available at https://github.com/HazyResearch/TART .</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive efforts in developing general-purpose LLMs that can be utilized in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been less research exploring their potential in recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PALR, which aiming to combine user history behaviors (such as clicks, purchases, ratings, etc.) with LLMs to generate user preferred items. Specifically, we first use user/item interactions as guidance for candidate retrieval. Then we adopt a LLM-based ranking model to generate recommended items. Unlike existing approaches that typically adopt general-purpose LLMs for zero/few-shot recommendation testing or training on small-sized language models (with less than 1 billion parameters), which cannot fully elicit LLMs' reasoning abilities and leverage rich item side parametric knowledge, we fine-tune a 7 billion parameters LLM for the ranking purpose. This model takes retrieval candidates in natural language format as input, with instruction which explicitly asking to select results from input candidates during inference. Our experimental results demonstrate that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art models on various sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@1 performance on HumanEval from 67\% to 85\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans. Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers. We release our code at https://github.com/ezelikman/parsel</p></details> | <details><summary>human...</summary><p>humaneval results, clarity</p></details> |

Existing ALM systems trigger LLM thought processes while pulling observations from these tools in an interleaved fashion. Specifically, an LLM reasons to call an external tool, gets halted to fetch the tool's response, and then decides the next action based on all preceding response tokens. Such a paradigm, though straightforward and easy to implement, often leads to huge computation complexity from redundant prompts and repeated execution. This study addresses such challenges for the first time, proposing a modular paradigm ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation) that detaches the reasoning process from external observations, thus significantly reducing token consumption. Comprehensive evaluations across six public NLP benchmarks and a curated dataset reveal consistent performance enhancements with our proposed methodology. Notably, ReWOO achieves 5x token efficiency and 4% accuracy improvement on HotpotQA, a multi-step reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, ReWOO demonstrates robustness under tool-failure scenarios. Beyond prompt efficiency, decoupling parametric modules from non-parametric tool calls enables instruction fine-tuning to offload LLMs into smaller language models, thus substantially reducing model parameters. Our illustrative work offloads reasoning ability from 175B GPT3.5 into 7B LLaMA, demonstrating the significant potential for truly efficient and scalable ALM systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Reliable Empirical Machine Unlearning Evaluation: A Game-Theoretic View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11577v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is the process of updating machine learning models to remove the information of specific training data samples, in order to comply with data protection regulations that allow individuals to request the removal of their personal data. Despite the recent development of numerous unlearning algorithms, reliable evaluation of these algorithms remains an open research question. In this work, we focus on membership inference attack (MIA) based evaluation, one of the most common approaches for evaluating unlearning algorithms, and address various pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics that lack reliability. Specifically, we propose a game-theoretic framework that formalizes the evaluation process as a game between unlearning algorithms and MIA adversaries, measuring the data removal efficacy of unlearning algorithms by the capability of the MIA adversaries. Through careful design of the game, we demonstrate that the natural evaluation metric induced from the game enjoys provable guarantees that the existing evaluation metrics fail to satisfy. Furthermore, we propose a practical and efficient algorithm to estimate the evaluation metric induced from the game, and demonstrate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. This work presents a novel and reliable approach to empirically evaluating unlearning algorithms, paving the way for the development of more effective unlearning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMEraser: Large Model Unlearning through Adaptive Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11056v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the growing demand for privacy protection in machine learning, we propose a novel and efficient machine unlearning approach for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{M}odels, called \textbf{LM}Eraser. Existing unlearning research suffers from entangled training data and complex model architectures, incurring extremely high computational costs for large models. LMEraser takes a divide-and-conquer strategy with a prompt tuning architecture to isolate data influence. The training dataset is partitioned into public and private datasets. Public data are used to train the backbone of the model. Private data are adaptively clustered based on their diversity, and each cluster is used to optimize a prompt separately. This adaptive prompt tuning mechanism reduces unlearning costs and maintains model performance. Experiments demonstrate that LMEraser achieves a $100$-fold reduction in unlearning costs without compromising accuracy compared to prior work. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/lmeraser/lmeraser}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offset Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11045v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, harmful, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose $\delta$-unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, $\delta$-unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that $\delta$-unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. $\delta$-unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact and Efficient Unlearning for Large Language Model-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10327v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolving paradigm of Large Language Model-based Recom- mendation (LLMRec) customizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using recommenda- tion data. The inclusion of user data in LLMs raises privacy concerns. To protect users, the unlearning process in LLMRec, specifically removing unusable data (e.g., historical behaviors) from established LLMRec models, becomes crucial. However, existing unlearning methods are insufficient for the unique characteristics of LLM- Rec, mainly due to high computational costs or incomplete data erasure. In this study, we introduce the Adapter Partition and Ag- gregation (APA) framework for exact and efficient unlearning while maintaining recommendation performance. APA achieves this by establishing distinct adapters for partitioned training data shards and retraining only the adapters impacted by unusable data for un- learning. To preserve recommendation performance and mitigate considerable inference costs, APA employs parameter-level adapter aggregation with sample-adaptive attention for individual testing samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Unlearning with Certified Client Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09724v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Federated Unlearning (FU) has gained attention for addressing the removal of a client's influence from the global model in Federated Learning (FL) systems, thereby ensuring the ``right to be forgotten" (RTBF). State-of-the-art methods for unlearning use historical data from FL clients, such as gradients or locally trained models. However, studies have revealed significant information leakage in this setting, with the possibility of reconstructing a user's local data from their uploaded information. Addressing this, we propose Starfish, a privacy-preserving federated unlearning scheme using Two-Party Computation (2PC) techniques and shared historical client data between two non-colluding servers. Starfish builds upon existing FU methods to ensure privacy in unlearning processes. To enhance the efficiency of privacy-preserving FU evaluations, we suggest 2PC-friendly alternatives for certain FU algorithm operations. We also implement strategies to reduce costs associated with 2PC operations and lessen cumulative approximation errors. Moreover, we establish a theoretical bound for the difference between the unlearned global model via Starfish and a global model retrained from scratch for certified client removal. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that Starfish achieves effective unlearning with reasonable efficiency, maintaining privacy and security in FL systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods suggest that one approach of data forgetting is by precomputing and storing statistics carrying second-order information to improve computational and memory efficiency. However, they rely on restrictive assumptions and the computation/storage suffer from the curse of model parameter dimensionality, making it challenging to apply to most deep neural networks. In this work, we propose a Hessian-free online unlearning method. We propose to maintain a statistical vector for each data point, computed through affine stochastic recursion approximation of the difference between retrained and learned models. Our proposed algorithm achieves near-instantaneous online unlearning as it only requires a vector addition operation. Based on the strategy that recollecting statistics for forgetting data, the proposed method significantly reduces the unlearning runtime. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time and memory costs, while also enhancing accuracy.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Eraser: Jailbreaking Defense in Large Language Models via Unlearning Harmful Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05880v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking attacks can enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to bypass the safeguard and generate harmful content. Existing jailbreaking defense methods have failed to address the fundamental issue that harmful knowledge resides within the model, leading to potential jailbreak risks for LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Eraser, which mainly includes three goals: unlearning harmful knowledge, retaining general knowledge, and maintaining safety alignment. The intuition is that if an LLM forgets the specific knowledge required to answer a harmful question, it will no longer have the ability to answer harmful questions. The training of Erase does not actually require the model's own harmful knowledge, and it can benefit from unlearning general answers related to harmful queries, which means it does not need assistance from the red team. The experimental results show that Eraser can significantly reduce the jailbreaking success rate for various attacks without compromising the general capabilities of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative Preference Optimization: From Catastrophic Collapse to Effective Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05868v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often memorize sensitive, private, or copyrighted data during pre-training. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse -- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities. In this paper, we propose Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish. Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10% of training data.</p></details> |  |

This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often suffer limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' for MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting data points). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach that can effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation tasks. As highlighted below, For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not.

However, existing studies of machine unlearning mainly focus on the efficacy and efficiency of unlearning methods, while neglecting the investigation of the privacy vulnerability during the unlearning process. With two versions of a model available to an adversary, that is, the original model and the unlearned model, machine unlearning opens up a new attack surface. In this paper, we conduct the first investigation to understand the extent to which machine unlearning can leak the confidential content of the unlearned data. Specifically, under the Machine Learning as a Service setting, we propose unlearning inversion attacks that can reveal the feature and label information of an unlearned sample by only accessing the original and unlearned model. The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed attack can reveal the sensitive information of the unlearned data. As such, we identify three possible defenses that help to mitigate the proposed attacks, while at the cost of reducing the utility of the unlearned model. The study in this paper uncovers an underexplored gap between machine unlearning and the privacy of unlearned data, highlighting the need for the careful design of mechanisms for implementing unlearning without leaking the information of the unlearned data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 45th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 20-23, 2024</p></details> |

It facilitates the removal of a user's data from federated trained machine learning models without the necessity for retraining from scratch. However, current machine unlearning algorithms are confronted with challenges of efficiency and validity.To address the above issues, we propose a new framework, named Goldfish. It comprises four modules: basic model, loss function, optimization, and extension. To address the challenge of low validity in existing machine unlearning algorithms, we propose a novel loss function. It takes into account the loss arising from the discrepancy between predictions and actual labels in the remaining dataset. Simultaneously, it takes into consideration the bias of predicted results on the removed dataset. Moreover, it accounts for the confidence level of predicted results. Additionally, to enhance efficiency, we adopt knowledge distillation technique in basic model and introduce an optimization module that encompasses the early termination mechanism guided by empirical risk and the data partition mechanism. Furthermore, to bolster the robustness of the aggregated model, we propose an extension module that incorporates a mechanism using adaptive distillation temperature to address the heterogeneity of user local data and a mechanism using adaptive weight to handle the variety in the quality of uploaded models. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

The motivations for forgetting include privacy protection, copyright protection, elimination of biases and discrimination, and prevention of harmful content generation. Effective digital forgetting has to be effective (meaning how well the new model has forgotten the undesired knowledge/behavior), retain the performance of the original model on the desirable tasks, and be scalable (in particular forgetting has to be more efficient than retraining from scratch on just the tasks/data to be retained). This survey focuses on forgetting in large language models (LLMs). We first provide background on LLMs, including their components, the types of LLMs, and their usual training pipeline. Second, we describe the motivations, types, and desired properties of digital forgetting. Third, we introduce the approaches to digital forgetting in LLMs, among which unlearning methodologies stand out as the state of the art. Fourth, we provide a detailed taxonomy of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, and we survey and compare current approaches. Fifth, we detail datasets, models and metrics used for the evaluation of forgetting, retaining and runtime. Sixth, we discuss challenges in the area.

| **[Corrupting Convolution-based Unlearnable Datasets with Pixel-based Image Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18403v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable datasets lead to a drastic drop in the generalization performance of models trained on them by introducing elaborate and imperceptible perturbations into clean training sets. Many existing defenses, e.g., JPEG compression and adversarial training, effectively counter UDs based on norm-constrained additive noise. However, a fire-new type of convolution-based UDs have been proposed and render existing defenses all ineffective, presenting a greater challenge to defenders. To address this, we express the convolution-based unlearnable sample as the result of multiplying a matrix by a clean sample in a simplified scenario, and formalize the intra-class matrix inconsistency as $\Theta_{imi}$, inter-class matrix consistency as $\Theta_{imc}$ to investigate the working mechanism of the convolution-based UDs. We conjecture that increasing both of these metrics will mitigate the unlearnability effect. Through validation experiments that commendably support our hypothesis, we further design a random matrix to boost both $\Theta_{imi}$ and $\Theta_{imc}$, achieving a notable degree of defense effect. Hence, by building upon and extending these facts, we first propose a brand-new image COrruption that employs randomly multiplicative transformation via INterpolation operation to successfully defend against convolution-based UDs. Our approach leverages global pixel random interpolations, effectively suppressing the impact of multiplicative noise in convolution-based UDs. Additionally, we have also designed two new forms of convolution-based UDs, and find that our defense is the most effective against them.</p></details> |  |

Machine unlearning has emerged to address this issue, aiming to delete data and reduce its impact on models according to user requests. Despite the widespread interest in machine unlearning, comprehensive surveys on its latest advancements, especially in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) is lacking. This survey aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth exploration of machine unlearning, including the definition, classification and evaluation criteria, as well as challenges in different environments and their solutions. Specifically, this paper categorizes and investigates unlearning on both traditional models and LLMs, and proposes methods for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of unlearning, and standards for performance measurement. This paper reveals the limitations of current unlearning techniques and emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive unlearning evaluation to avoid arbitrary forgetting. This survey not only summarizes the key concepts of unlearning technology but also points out its prominent issues and feasible directions for future research, providing valuable guidance for scholars in the field.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Label-Agnostic Forgetting: A Supervision-Free Unlearning in Deep Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00506v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to remove information derived from forgotten data while preserving that of the remaining dataset in a well-trained model. With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, several approaches to machine unlearning have emerged. However, these methods typically rely on complete supervision throughout the unlearning process. Unfortunately, obtaining such supervision, whether for the forgetting or remaining data, can be impractical due to the substantial cost associated with annotating real-world datasets. This challenge prompts us to propose a supervision-free unlearning approach that operates without the need for labels during the unlearning process. Specifically, we introduce a variational approach to approximate the distribution of representations for the remaining data. Leveraging this approximation, we adapt the original model to eliminate information from the forgotten data at the representation level. To further address the issue of lacking supervision information, which hinders alignment with ground truth, we introduce a contrastive loss to facilitate the matching of representations between the remaining data and those of the original model, thus preserving predictive performance. Experimental results across various unlearning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, Label-Agnostic Forgetting (LAF) without using any labels, which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods that rely on full supervision information. Furthermore, our approach excels in semi-supervised scenarios, leveraging limited supervision information to outperform fully supervised baselines. This work not only showcases the viability of supervision-free unlearning in deep models but also opens up a new possibility for future research in unlearning at the representation level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Unlearning for Pre-trained GANs and VAEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05699v4)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the problem of feature unlearning from a pre-trained image generative model: GANs and VAEs. Unlike a common unlearning task where an unlearning target is a subset of the training set, we aim to unlearn a specific feature, such as hairstyle from facial images, from the pre-trained generative models. As the target feature is only presented in a local region of an image, unlearning the entire image from the pre-trained model may result in losing other details in the remaining region of the image. To specify which features to unlearn, we collect randomly generated images that contain the target features. We then identify a latent representation corresponding to the target feature and then use the representation to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Through experiments on MNIST, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets, we show that target features are successfully removed while keeping the fidelity of the original models. Further experiments with an adversarial attack show that the unlearned model is more robust under the presence of malicious parties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13682v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention recently for its potential to achieve Safe AI by removing the influence of specific data from trained machine learning models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses AI governance concerns of training data such as quality, sensitivity, copyright restrictions, and obsolescence. This capability is also crucial for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as the Right To Be Forgotten. Furthermore, effective knowledge removal mitigates the risk of harmful outcomes, safeguarding against biases, misinformation, and unauthorized data exploitation, thereby enhancing the safe and responsible use of AI systems. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service, allowing users to submit requests to remove specific data from the training corpus. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems, such as information leakage and malicious unlearning requests, that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. For instance, unlearning can act as a mechanism to recover models from backdoor attacks, while backdoor attacks themselves can serve as an evaluation metric for unlearning effectiveness. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay among these mechanisms in maintaining system functionality and safety. This survey aims to fill the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations.</p></details> |  |

Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the effect of certain data points on the trained model parameters so that it can be approximately the same as if one retrains the model from scratch. This work proposes stochastic gradient Langevin unlearning, the first unlearning framework based on noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems under convexity assumption. Our results show that mini-batch gradient updates provide a superior privacy-complexity trade-off compared to the full-batch counterpart. There are numerous algorithmic benefits of our unlearning approach, including complexity saving compared to retraining, and supporting sequential and batch unlearning. To examine the privacy-utility-complexity trade-off of our method, we conduct experiments on benchmark datasets compared against prior works. Our approach achieves a similar utility under the same privacy constraint while using $2\%$ and $10\%$ of the gradient computations compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based approximate unlearning methods for mini-batch and full-batch settings, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.10371</p></details> |
| **[Unlearning Backdoor Threats: Enhancing Backdoor Defense in Multimodal Contrastive Learning via Local Token Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16257v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for building high-quality features using the complementary strengths of various data modalities. However, the open nature of such systems inadvertently increases the possibility of backdoor attacks. These attacks subtly embed malicious behaviors within the model during training, which can be activated by specific triggers in the inference phase, posing significant security risks. Despite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the adverse impacts of such attacks, these defenses often degrade the clean accuracy and necessitate the construction of extensive clean training pairs. In this paper, we explore the possibility of a less-cost defense from the perspective of model unlearning, that is, whether the model can be made to quickly \textbf{u}nlearn \textbf{b}ackdoor \textbf{t}hreats (UBT) by constructing a small set of poisoned samples. Specifically, we strengthen the backdoor shortcuts to discover suspicious samples through overfitting training prioritized by weak similarity samples. Building on the initial identification of suspicious samples, we introduce an innovative token-based localized forgetting training regime. This technique specifically targets the poisoned aspects of the model, applying a focused effort to unlearn the backdoor associations and trying not to damage the integrity of the overall model. Experimental results show that our method not only ensures a minimal success rate for attacks, but also preserves the model's high clean accuracy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The emerging discipline of Machine Unlearning has arisen as a pivotal area of research, facilitating the process of selectively discarding information designated to specific sets or classes of data from a pre-trained model, thereby eliminating the necessity for extensive retraining from scratch. The principal aim of this study is to formulate a methodology tailored for the purposeful elimination of information linked to a specific class of data from a pre-trained classification network. This intentional removal is crafted to degrade the model's performance specifically concerning the unlearned data class while concurrently minimizing any detrimental impacts on the model's performance in other classes. To achieve this goal, we frame the class unlearning problem from a Bayesian perspective, which yields a loss function that minimizes the log-likelihood associated with the unlearned data with a stability regularization in parameter space. This stability regularization incorporates Mohalanobis distance with respect to the Fisher Information matrix and $l_2$ distance from the pre-trained model parameters. Our novel approach, termed \textbf{Partially-Blinded Unlearning (PBU)}, surpasses existing state-of-the-art class unlearning methods, demonstrating superior effectiveness. Notably, PBU achieves this efficacy without requiring awareness of the entire training dataset but only to the unlearned data points, marking a distinctive feature of its performance.</p></details> |  |

For Now](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11868v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized the generation of realistic and complex images. However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as producing harmful content and infringing data copyrights. Despite the development of safety-driven unlearning techniques to counteract these challenges, doubts about their efficacy persist. To tackle this issue, we introduce an evaluation framework that leverages adversarial prompts to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-driven DMs after they have undergone the process of unlearning harmful concepts. Specifically, we investigated the adversarial robustness of DMs, assessed by adversarial prompts, when eliminating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects. We develop an effective and efficient adversarial prompt generation approach for DMs, termed UnlearnDiffAtk. This method capitalizes on the intrinsic classification abilities of DMs to simplify the creation of adversarial prompts, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary classification or diffusion models.Through extensive benchmarking, we evaluate the robustness of five widely-used safety-driven unlearned DMs (i.e., DMs after unlearning undesirable concepts, styles, or objects) across a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency merits of UnlearnDiffAtk over the state-of-the-art adversarial prompt generation method and reveal the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques when applied to DMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Diffusion-MU-Attack.

Nonetheless, they pose risks by potentially memorizing and disseminating sensitive, biased, or copyrighted information from their vast datasets. Machine unlearning emerges as a cutting-edge solution to mitigate these concerns, offering techniques for LLMs to selectively discard certain data. This paper reviews the latest in machine unlearning for LLMs, introducing methods for the targeted forgetting of information to address privacy, ethical, and legal challenges without necessitating full model retraining. It divides existing research into unlearning from unstructured/textual data and structured/classification data, showcasing the effectiveness of these approaches in removing specific data while maintaining model efficacy. Highlighting the practicality of machine unlearning, this analysis also points out the hurdles in preserving model integrity, avoiding excessive or insufficient data removal, and ensuring consistent outputs, underlining the role of machine unlearning in advancing responsible, ethical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\nabla τ$: Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14339v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks, including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$ requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Has Approximate Machine Unlearning been evaluated properly? From Auditing to Side Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12830v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing concerns surrounding data privacy and security have underscored the critical necessity for machine unlearning--aimed at fully removing data lineage from machine learning models. MLaaS providers expect this to be their ultimate safeguard for regulatory compliance. Despite its critical importance, the pace at which privacy communities have been developing and implementing strong methods to verify the effectiveness of machine unlearning has been disappointingly slow, with this vital area often receiving insufficient focus. This paper seeks to address this shortfall by introducing well-defined and effective metrics for black-box unlearning auditing tasks. We transform the auditing challenge into a question of non-membership inference and develop efficient metrics for auditing. By relying exclusively on the original and unlearned models--eliminating the need to train additional shadow models--our approach simplifies the evaluation of unlearning at the individual data point level. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct an in-depth analysis of current approximate machine unlearning algorithms, identifying three key directions where these approaches fall short: utility, resilience, and equity. Our aim is that this work will greatly improve our understanding of approximate machine unlearning methods, taking a significant stride towards converting the theoretical right to data erasure into a auditable reality.</p></details> |  |

Federated Unlearning (FU) consists in extending MU to unlearn a given client's contribution from a federated training routine. While several FU methods have been proposed, we currently lack a general approach providing formal unlearning guarantees to the FedAvg routine, while ensuring scalability and generalization beyond the convex assumption on the clients' loss functions. We aim at filling this gap by proposing SIFU (Sequential Informed Federated Unlearning), a new FU method applying to both convex and non-convex optimization regimes. SIFU naturally applies to FedAvg without additional computational cost for the clients and provides formal guarantees on the quality of the unlearning task. We provide a theoretical analysis of the unlearning properties of SIFU, and practically demonstrate its effectiveness as compared to a panel of unlearning methods from the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to selectively remove specific training data points' influence on trained models. This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of the solutions in machine unlearning. We categorize existing solutions into exact unlearning approaches that remove data influence thoroughly and approximate unlearning approaches that efficiently minimize data influence. By comprehensively reviewing solutions, we identify and discuss their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose future directions to advance machine unlearning and establish it as an essential capability for trustworthy and adaptive machine learning models. This paper provides researchers with a roadmap of open problems, encouraging impactful contributions to address real-world needs for selective data removal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second-Order Information Matters: Revisiting Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10557v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we have witnessed intense competition among the major LLM products like ChatGPT, LLaMa, and Gemini. However, various issues (e.g. privacy leakage and copyright violation) of the training corpus still remain underexplored. For example, the Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for infringing on its copyrights by using millions of its articles for training. From the perspective of LLM practitioners, handling such unintended privacy violations can be challenging. Previous work addressed the ``unlearning" problem of LLMs using gradient information, while they mostly introduced significant overheads like data preprocessing or lacked robustness. In this paper, contrasting with the methods based on first-order information, we revisit the unlearning problem via the perspective of second-order information (Hessian). Our unlearning algorithms, which are inspired by classic Newton update, are not only data-agnostic/model-agnostic but also proven to be robust in terms of utility preservation or privacy guarantee. Through a comprehensive evaluation with four NLP datasets as well as a case study on real-world datasets, our methods consistently show superiority over the first-order methods.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge graph (KG) embedding representation provides a foundation for knowledge reasoning and applications by mapping entities and relations into vector space. Federated KG embedding enables the utilization of knowledge from diverse client sources while safeguarding the privacy of local data. However, due to demands such as privacy protection and the need to adapt to dynamic data changes, investigations into machine unlearning (MU) have been sparked. However, it is challenging to maintain the performance of KG embedding models while forgetting the influence of specific forgotten data on the model. In this paper, we propose FedDM, a novel framework tailored for machine unlearning in federated knowledge graphs. Leveraging diffusion models, we generate noisy data to sensibly mitigate the influence of specific knowledge on FL models while preserving the overall performance concerning the remaining data. We conduct experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets to assess the efficacy of the proposed model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDM yields promising results in knowledge forgetting.</p></details> |  |

Data users have been endowed with the right to be forgotten of their data. In the course of machine learning (ML), the forgotten right requires a model provider to delete user data and its subsequent impact on ML models upon user requests. Machine unlearning emerges to address this, which has garnered ever-increasing attention from both industry and academia. While the area has developed rapidly, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys to capture the latest advancements. Recognizing this shortage, we conduct an extensive exploration to map the landscape of machine unlearning including the (fine-grained) taxonomy of unlearning algorithms under centralized and distributed settings, debate on approximate unlearning, verification and evaluation metrics, challenges and solutions for unlearning under different applications, as well as attacks targeting machine unlearning. The survey concludes by outlining potential directions for future research, hoping to serve as a guide for interested scholars.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs may be trained on undesirable graph data, which can degrade their performance and reliability. To enable trained GNNs to efficiently unlearn unwanted data, a desirable solution is retraining-based graph unlearning, which partitions the training graph into subgraphs and trains sub-models on them, allowing fast unlearning through partial retraining. However, the graph partition process causes information loss in the training graph, resulting in the low model utility of sub-GNN models. In this paper, we propose GraphRevoker, a novel graph unlearning framework that better maintains the model utility of unlearnable GNNs. Specifically, we preserve the graph property with graph property-aware sharding and effectively aggregate the sub-GNN models for prediction with graph contrastive sub-model aggregation.

With the advent of regulations like the GDPR emphasizing data privacy and the right to be forgotten, machine learning models face the daunting task of unlearning sensitive information without compromising their integrity or performance. Our research introduces a novel approach that leverages influence functions and principles of distributional independence to address these challenges. By proposing a comprehensive framework for machine unlearning, we aim to ensure privacy protection while maintaining model performance and adaptability across varying distributions. Our method not only facilitates efficient data removal but also dynamically adjusts the model to preserve its generalization capabilities. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in scenarios characterized by significant distributional shifts, making substantial contributions to the field of machine unlearning. This research paves the way for developing more resilient and adaptable unlearning techniques, ensuring models remain robust and accurate in the dynamic landscape of data privacy and machine learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Deletion from Trained Models through Layer-wise Partial Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07611v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning has garnered significant attention due to its ability to selectively erase knowledge obtained from specific training data samples in an already trained machine learning model. This capability enables data holders to adhere strictly to data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning techniques face practical constraints, often causing performance degradation, demanding brief fine-tuning post unlearning, and requiring significant storage. In response, this paper introduces a novel class of machine unlearning algorithms. First method is partial amnesiac unlearning, integration of layer-wise pruning with amnesiac unlearning. In this method, updates made to the model during training are pruned and stored, subsequently used to forget specific data from trained model. The second method assimilates layer-wise partial-updates into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning to mitigate the adverse effects of data deletion on model efficacy. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, we showcase the effectiveness of proposed unlearning methods. Experimental results highlight that the partial amnesiac unlearning not only preserves model efficacy but also eliminates the necessity for brief post fine-tuning, unlike conventional amnesiac unlearning. Moreover, employing layer-wise partial updates in label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning techniques demonstrates superiority in preserving model efficacy compared to their naive counterparts.</p></details> | 16pages, 4 figures |
| **[Challenging Forgets: Unveiling the Worst-Case Forget Sets in Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07362v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively 'unlearning' data points after training. This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies. Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.

This concept is pivotal in enforcing the \textit{right to be forgotten}, which entails the selective removal of specific data from trained GNNs upon user request. Our research focuses on edge unlearning, a process of particular relevance to real-world applications. Current state-of-the-art approaches like GNNDelete can eliminate the influence of specific edges yet suffer from \textit{over-forgetting}, which means the unlearning process inadvertently removes excessive information beyond needed, leading to a significant performance decline for remaining edges. Our analysis identifies the loss functions of GNNDelete as the primary source of over-forgetting and also suggests that loss functions may be redundant for effective edge unlearning. Building on these insights, we simplify GNNDelete to develop \textbf{Unlink to Unlearn} (UtU), a novel method that facilitates unlearning exclusively through unlinking the forget edges from graph structure. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UtU delivers privacy protection on par with that of a retrained model while preserving high accuracy in downstream tasks, by upholding over 97.3\% of the retrained model's privacy protection capabilities and 99.8\% of its link prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, UtU requires only constant computational demands, underscoring its advantage as a highly lightweight and practical edge unlearning solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2024 as a Short Research Paper</p></details> |

Existing studies predominantly use training data, i.e., model inputs, as unlearning target. However, attackers can extract private information from the model even if it has not been explicitly encountered during training. We name this unseen information as \textit{attribute} and treat it as unlearning target. To protect the sensitive attribute of users, Attribute Unlearning (AU) aims to make target attributes indistinguishable. In this paper, we focus on a strict but practical setting of AU, namely Post-Training Attribute Unlearning (PoT-AU), where unlearning can only be performed after the training of the recommendation model is completed. To address the PoT-AU problem in recommender systems, we propose a two-component loss function. The first component is distinguishability loss, where we design a distribution-based measurement to make attribute labels indistinguishable from attackers. We further extend this measurement to handle multi-class attribute cases with efficient computational overhead. The second component is regularization loss, where we explore a function-space measurement that effectively maintains recommendation performance compared to parameter-space regularization. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm to optimize our proposed loss. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05847</p></details> |

Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement. However, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e., remove the impact of) part of training data if the these data are found to be malicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning which is specifically designed to remove the influence of part of the dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct unlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance between unlearning completeness and model performance, a performance-aware algorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local model parameter change using influence function and sample re-weighting. Furthermore, we observe that the statistical criterion such as mean squared error, cannot fully reflect the operation cost of the downstream tasks in power system. Therefore, a task-aware machine unlearning is proposed whose objective is a trilevel optimization with dispatch and redispatch problems considered. We theoretically prove the existence of the gradient of such an objective, which is key to re-weighting the remaining samples. We tested the unlearning algorithms on linear, CNN, and MLP-Mixer based load forecasters with a realistic load dataset. The simulation demonstrates the balance between unlearning completeness and operational cost.

| **[Learning the Unlearned: Mitigating Feature Suppression in Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11816v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning has proven effective in deriving high-quality representations from unlabeled data. However, a major challenge that hinders both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning is feature suppression, a phenomenon where the trained model captures only a limited portion of the information from the input data while overlooking other potentially valuable content. This issue often leads to indistinguishable representations for visually similar but semantically different inputs, adversely affecting downstream task performance, particularly those requiring rigorous semantic comprehension. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model-agnostic Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework. Unlike standard contrastive learning which inherently captures one single biased feature distribution, MCL progressively learns previously unlearned features through feature-aware negative sampling at each stage, where the negative samples of an anchor are exclusively selected from the cluster it was assigned to in preceding stages. Meanwhile, MCL preserves the previously well-learned features by cross-stage representation integration, integrating features across all stages to form final representations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MCL's effectiveness and superiority across both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning, spanning a range of model architectures from ResNet to Vision Transformers (ViT). Remarkably, in tasks where the original CLIP model has shown limitations, MCL dramatically enhances performance, with improvements up to threefold on specific attributes in the recently proposed MMVP benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations.

The efficacy of LLMRec arises from the open-world knowledge and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. LLMRec acquires the recommendation capabilities through instruction tuning based on user interaction data. However, in order to protect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to intentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as recommendation unlearning. In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses new challenges for LLMRec in terms of \textit{inefficiency} and \textit{ineffectiveness}. Existing unlearning methods require updating billions of parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming. Besides, they always impact the model utility during the unlearning process. To this end, we propose \textbf{E2URec}, the first \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{U}nlearning method for LLM\underline{Rec}. Our proposed E2URec enhances the unlearning efficiency by updating only a few additional LoRA parameters, and improves the unlearning effectiveness by employing a teacher-student framework, where we maintain multiple teacher networks to guide the unlearning process. Extensive experiments show that E2URec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets. Specifically, E2URec can efficiently forget specific data without affecting recommendation performance. The source code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/E2URec}.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, fine-tuning can be expensive, as it requires both generating a set of examples and running iterations of fine-tuning to update the model. In this work, we show that simple guardrail-based approaches such as prompting and filtering can achieve unlearning results comparable to fine-tuning. We recommend that researchers investigate these lightweight baselines when evaluating the performance of more computationally intensive fine-tuning methods. While we do not claim that methods such as prompting or filtering are universal solutions to the problem of unlearning, our work suggests the need for evaluation metrics that can better separate the power of guardrails vs. fine-tuning, and highlights scenarios where guardrails themselves may be advantageous for unlearning, such as in generating examples for fine-tuning or unlearning when only API access is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, accepted to ICLR workshop SeT-LLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[SoK: Challenges and Opportunities in Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02437v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL), introduced in 2017, facilitates collaborative learning between non-trusting parties with no need for the parties to explicitly share their data among themselves. This allows training models on user data while respecting privacy regulations such as GDPR and CPRA. However, emerging privacy requirements may mandate model owners to be able to \emph{forget} some learned data, e.g., when requested by data owners or law enforcement. This has given birth to an active field of research called \emph{machine unlearning}. In the context of FL, many techniques developed for unlearning in centralized settings are not trivially applicable! This is due to the unique differences between centralized and distributed learning, in particular, interactivity, stochasticity, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility in FL. In response, a recent line of work has focused on developing unlearning mechanisms tailored to FL. This SoK paper aims to take a deep look at the \emph{federated unlearning} literature, with the goal of identifying research trends and challenges in this emerging field. By carefully categorizing papers published on FL unlearning (since 2020), we aim to pinpoint the unique complexities of federated unlearning, highlighting limitations on directly applying centralized unlearning methods. We compare existing federated unlearning methods regarding influence removal and performance recovery, compare their threat models and assumptions, and discuss their implications and limitations. For instance, we analyze the experimental setup of FL unlearning studies from various perspectives, including data heterogeneity and its simulation, the datasets used for demonstration, and evaluation metrics. Our work aims to offer insights and suggestions for future research on federated unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Language Models: Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01267v1)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and shaping the behaviour of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important as applications become more powerful and more frequently adopted. This paper introduces a machine unlearning method specifically designed for LLMs. We introduce a selective pruning method for LLMs that removes neurons based on their relative importance on a targeted capability compared to overall network performance. This approach is a compute- and data-efficient method for identifying and removing neurons that enable specific behaviours. Our findings reveal that both feed-forward and attention neurons in LLMs are specialized; that is, for specific tasks, certain neurons are more crucial than others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inexact Unlearning Needs More Careful Evaluations to Avoid a False Sense of Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01218v1)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of model training makes it increasingly desirable to develop techniques for unlearning. These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their ``U-MIA'' counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into ``population U-MIAs'', where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and ``per-example U-MIAs'', where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail to alleviate these issues.</p></details> |  |

Most existing machine unlearning approaches require a model to be fine-tuned to remove information while preserving performance. This is computationally expensive and necessitates the storage of the whole dataset for the lifetime of the model. Retraining-free approaches often utilise Fisher information, which is derived from the loss and requires labelled data which may not be available. Thus, we present an extension to the Selective Synaptic Dampening algorithm, substituting the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix for the gradient of the l2 norm of the model output to approximate sensitivity. We evaluate our method in a range of experiments using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer. Results show our label-free method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Tiny Paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Through rigorous evaluation using curated datasets from arXiv, books, and GitHub, we establish a robust benchmark for unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods are over $10^5$ times more computationally efficient than retraining. Our results show that integrating gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness. We also provide detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning in the unlearning process.

| **[Eight Methods to Evaluate Robust Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16835v1)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning can be useful for removing harmful capabilities and memorized text from large language models (LLMs), but there are not yet standardized methods for rigorously evaluating it. In this paper, we first survey techniques and limitations of existing unlearning evaluations. Second, we apply a comprehensive set of tests for the robustness and competitiveness of unlearning in the "Who's Harry Potter" (WHP) model from Eldan and Russinovich (2023). While WHP's unlearning generalizes well when evaluated with the "Familiarity" metric from Eldan and Russinovich, we find i) higher-than-baseline amounts of knowledge can reliably be extracted, ii) WHP performs on par with the original model on Harry Potter Q&A tasks, iii) it represents latent knowledge comparably to the original model, and iv) there is collateral unlearning in related domains. Overall, our results highlight the importance of comprehensive unlearning evaluation that avoids ad-hoc metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnlearnCanvas: A Stylized Image Dataset to Benchmark Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11846v2)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models (DMs) has not only transformed various real-world industries but has also introduced negative societal concerns, including the generation of harmful content, copyright disputes, and the rise of stereotypes and biases. To mitigate these issues, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a potential solution, demonstrating its ability to remove undesired generative capabilities of DMs in various applications. However, by examining existing MU evaluation methods, we uncover several key challenges that can result in incomplete, inaccurate, or biased evaluations for MU in DMs. To address them, we enhance the evaluation metrics for MU, including the introduction of an often-overlooked retainability measurement for DMs post-unlearning. Additionally, we introduce UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates us to evaluate the unlearning of artistic painting styles in conjunction with associated image objects. We show that this dataset plays a pivotal role in establishing a standardized and automated evaluation framework for MU techniques on DMs, featuring 7 quantitative metrics to address various aspects of unlearning effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 5 state-of-the-art MU methods, revealing novel insights into their pros and cons, and the underlying unlearning mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of UnlearnCanvas to benchmark other generative modeling tasks, such as style transfer. The UnlearnCanvas dataset, benchmark, and the codes to reproduce all the results in this work can be found at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/UnlearnCanvas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Federated Unlearning on Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16294v1)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchained Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining traction for ensuring the integrity and traceability of FL processes. Blockchained FL involves participants training models locally with their data and subsequently publishing the models on the blockchain, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-like inheritance structure that represents the model relationship. However, this particular DAG-based structure presents challenges in updating models with sensitive data, due to the complexity and overhead involved. To address this, we propose Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a generic framework that redesigns the blockchain structure using Chameleon Hash (CH) technology to mitigate the complexity of model updating, thereby reducing the computational and consensus costs of unlearning tasks.Furthermore, BlockFUL supports various federated unlearning methods, ensuring the integrity and traceability of model updates, whether conducted in parallel or serial. We conduct a comprehensive study of two typical unlearning methods, gradient ascent and re-training, demonstrating the efficient unlearning workflow in these two categories with minimal CH and block update operations. Additionally, we compare the computation and communication costs of these methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine unlearning through fine-grained model parameters perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04385v2)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning techniques, which involve retracting data records and reducing influence of said data on trained models, help with the user privacy protection objective but incur significant computational costs. Weight perturbation-based unlearning is a general approach, but it typically involves globally modifying the parameters. We propose fine-grained Top-K and Random-k parameters perturbed inexact machine unlearning strategies that address the privacy needs while keeping the computational costs tractable. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of our strategies we also tackle the challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of machine unlearning by considering the model's generalization performance across both unlearning and remaining data. To better assess the unlearning effect and model generalization, we propose novel metrics, namely, the forgetting rate and memory retention rate. However, for inexact machine unlearning, current metrics are inadequate in quantifying the degree of forgetting that occurs after unlearning strategies are applied. To address this, we introduce SPD-GAN, which subtly perturbs the distribution of data targeted for unlearning. Then, we evaluate the degree of unlearning by measuring the performance difference of the models on the perturbed unlearning data before and after the unlearning process. By implementing these innovative techniques and metrics, we achieve computationally efficacious privacy protection in machine learning applications without significant sacrifice of model performance. Furthermore, this approach provides a novel method for evaluating the degree of unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning by Suppressing Sample Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15109v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) is to forget data from a well-trained model, which is practically important due to the "right to be forgotten". In this paper, we start from the fundamental distinction between training data and unseen data on their contribution to the model: the training data contributes to the final model while the unseen data does not. We theoretically discover that the input sensitivity can approximately measure the contribution and practically design an algorithm, called MU-Mis (machine unlearning via minimizing input sensitivity), to suppress the contribution of the forgetting data. Experimental results demonstrate that MU-Mis outperforms state-of-the-art MU methods significantly. Additionally, MU-Mis aligns more closely with the application of MU as it does not require the use of remaining data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Trilemma of Privacy, Utility, Efficiency via Controllable Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18574v2)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) algorithms have become increasingly critical due to the imperative adherence to data privacy regulations. The primary objective of MU is to erase the influence of specific data samples on a given model without the need to retrain it from scratch. Accordingly, existing methods focus on maximizing user privacy protection. However, there are different degrees of privacy regulations for each real-world web-based application. Exploring the full spectrum of trade-offs between privacy, model utility, and runtime efficiency is critical for practical unlearning scenarios. Furthermore, designing the MU algorithm with simple control of the aforementioned trade-off is desirable but challenging due to the inherent complex interaction. To address the challenges, we present Controllable Machine Unlearning (ConMU), a novel framework designed to facilitate the calibration of MU. The ConMU framework contains three integral modules: an important data selection module that reconciles the runtime efficiency and model generalization, a progressive Gaussian mechanism module that balances privacy and model generalization, and an unlearning proxy that controls the trade-offs between privacy and runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets have demonstrated the robust adaptability of our control mechanism and its superiority over established unlearning methods. ConMU explores the full spectrum of the Privacy-Utility-Efficiency trade-off and allows practitioners to account for different real-world regulations.

| **[Corrective Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14015v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning models increasingly face data integrity challenges due to the use of large-scale training datasets drawn from the internet. We study what model developers can do if they detect that some data was manipulated or incorrect. Such manipulated data can cause adverse effects like vulnerability to backdoored samples, systematic biases, and in general, reduced accuracy on certain input domains. Often, all manipulated training samples are not known, and only a small, representative subset of the affected data is flagged. We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples. We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning. We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning. However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting. We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15910v4)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, known as \emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference attack'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10683v2)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to perform unlearning, i.e. forgetting undesirable misbehaviors, on large language models (LLMs). We show at least three scenarios of aligning LLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmful responses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3) reducing hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has three advantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which are much easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting) than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in RLHF (RL from human feedback). (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It is especially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLM unlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, and evaluations in LLM unlearning. We show that if practitioners only have limited resources, and therefore the priority is to stop generating undesirable outputs rather than to try to generate desirable outputs, unlearning is particularly appealing. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows that unlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just 2% of its computational time.</p></details> |  |

Instead of centralizing raw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global model incrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to be forgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their data contributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it is recognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global model through updates, e.g. to generate mispredictions on specially crafted data examples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guarantee individuals the possibility to remove their data and erase malicious contributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired "good" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel Federated Unlearning (FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributions without full model retraining. This survey provides background concepts, empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FU schemes. Our study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluating unlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizing state-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy. Finally, we outline the most relevant and still open technical challenges, by identifying the most promising research directions in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, and 6 tables</p></details> |

This principle allows individuals to request that their personal data be deleted from deployed machine learning models. While "forgetting" can be naively achieved by retraining on the remaining dataset, it is computationally expensive to do to so with each new request. As such, several machine unlearning methods have been proposed as efficient alternatives to retraining. These methods aim to approximate the predictive performance of retraining, but fail to consider how unlearning impacts other properties critical to real-world applications such as fairness. In this work, we demonstrate that most efficient unlearning methods cannot accommodate popular fairness interventions, and we propose the first fair machine unlearning method that can efficiently unlearn data instances from a fair objective. We derive theoretical results which demonstrate that our method can provably unlearn data and provably maintain fairness performance. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets highlight the efficacy of our method at unlearning data instances while preserving fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted to AISTATS 2024.

However, LLMs often encounter challenges in generating harmful content when faced with problematic prompts. To address this problem, existing work attempted to implement a gradient ascent based approach to prevent LLMs from producing harmful output. While these methods can be effective, they frequently impact the model utility in responding to normal prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Selective Knowledge negation Unlearning (SKU), a novel unlearning framework for LLMs, designed to eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving utility on normal prompts. Specifically, SKU is consisted of two stages: harmful knowledge acquisition stage and knowledge negation stage. The first stage aims to identify and acquire harmful knowledge within the model, whereas the second is dedicated to remove this knowledge. SKU selectively isolates and removes harmful knowledge in model parameters, ensuring the model's performance remains robust on normal prompts. Our experiments conducted across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SKU identifies a good balance point between removing harmful information and preserving utility.</p></details> | 13 pages in total |

To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we borrow the idea of unlearning and propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which can eliminate hallucinations without the need for paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trigg...</summary><p>Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment</p></details> |

We capitalize on the capabilities of strong Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to facilitate the unlearning of specific samples from a trained model. We consider the scenario of two networks, the attacker $\mathbf{A}$ and the trained defender $\mathbf{D}$ pitted against each other in an adversarial objective, wherein the attacker aims at teasing out the information of the data to be unlearned in order to infer membership, and the defender unlearns to defend the network against the attack, whilst preserving its general performance. The algorithm can be trained end-to-end using backpropagation, following the well known iterative min-max approach in updating the attacker and the defender. We additionally incorporate a self-supervised objective effectively addressing the feature space discrepancies between the forget set and the validation set, enhancing unlearning performance. Our proposed algorithm closely approximates the ideal benchmark of retraining from scratch for both random sample forgetting and class-wise forgetting schemes on standard machine-unlearning datasets. Specifically, on the class unlearning scheme, the method demonstrates near-optimal performance and comprehensively overcomes known methods over the random sample forgetting scheme across all metrics and multiple network pruning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including references, 2 tables, 2 figures and 1 algorithm</p></details> |

We introduce key metrics for FU assessment, concentrating on verification, global stability, and local fairness, and investigate the inherent trade-offs. Furthermore, we formulate the unlearning process with data heterogeneity through an optimization framework. Our key contribution lies in a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the trade-offs in FU and provides insights into data heterogeneity's impacts on FU. Leveraging these insights, we propose FU mechanisms to manage the trade-offs, guiding further development for FU mechanisms. We empirically validate that our FU mechanisms effectively balance trade-offs, confirming insights derived from our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Here, a novel approach is introduced to achieve precise and selective forgetting within language models. Unlike previous methodologies that adopt completely opposing training objectives, this approach aims to mitigate adverse effects on language model performance, particularly in generation tasks. Furthermore, two innovative evaluation metrics are proposed: Sensitive Information Extraction Likelihood (S-EL) and Sensitive Information Memory Accuracy (S-MA), designed to gauge the effectiveness of sensitive information elimination. To reinforce the forgetting framework, an effective method for annotating sensitive scopes is presented, involving both online and offline strategies. The online selection mechanism leverages language probability scores to ensure computational efficiency, while the offline annotation entails a robust two-stage process based on Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |

Researchers have provided a probabilistic notion of approximate unlearning under a similar definition of Differential Privacy (DP), where privacy is defined as statistical indistinguishability to retraining from scratch. We propose Langevin unlearning, an unlearning framework based on noisy gradient descent with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems. Langevin unlearning unifies the DP learning process and the privacy-certified unlearning process with many algorithmic benefits. These include approximate certified unlearning for non-convex problems, complexity saving compared to retraining, sequential and batch unlearning for multiple unlearning requests. We verify the practicality of Langevin unlearning by studying its privacy-utility-complexity trade-off via experiments on benchmark datasets, and also demonstrate its superiority against gradient-decent-plus-output-perturbation based approximate unlearning.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity and power, these models have been found to produce unexpected or discriminatory outcomes. Given their overwhelming success for most tasks, it is of interest to identify sources of their unexpected and discriminatory behavior. However, there has not been much work on understanding and debugging tree-based classifiers in the context of fairness. We introduce FairDebugger, a system that utilizes recent advances in machine unlearning research to identify training data subsets responsible for instances of fairness violations in the outcomes of a random forest classifier. FairDebugger generates top-$k$ explanations (in the form of coherent training data subsets) for model unfairness. Toward this goal, FairDebugger first utilizes machine unlearning to estimate the change in the tree structures of the random forest when parts of the underlying training data are removed, and then leverages the Apriori algorithm from frequent itemset mining to reduce the subset search space. We empirically evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets, and demonstrate that the explanations generated by FairDebugger are consistent with insights from prior studies on these datasets.</p></details> |  |

When a model has been trained on a dataset containing such errors its performance is reduced. This leads to the challenge of efficiently unlearning the influence of the erroneous data to improve the model performance without needing to completely retrain the model. While model editing methods exist for cases in which the correct label for a wrong entry is known, we focus on the case of data entry errors where we do not know the correct labels for the erroneous data. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an extension to the selective synaptic dampening unlearning method that removes the need for parameter tuning, making unlearning accessible to practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of this extension, adaptive selective synaptic dampening (ASSD), on various ResNet18 and Vision Transformer unlearning tasks. Second, we demonstrate the performance of ASSD in a supply chain delay prediction problem with labelling errors using real-world data where we randomly introduce various levels of labelling errors. The application of this approach is particularly compelling in industrial settings, such as supply chain management, where a significant portion of data entry occurs manually through Excel sheets, rendering it error-prone. ASSD shows strong performance on general unlearning benchmarks and on the error correction problem where it outperforms fine-tuning for error correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Federated Unlearning: A Taxonomy, Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19218v3)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) has led to an increasing demand for implementing the right to be forgotten. The implementation of selective forgetting is particularly challenging in FL due to its decentralized nature. This complexity has given rise to a new field, Federated Unlearning (FU). FU emerges as a strategic solution to address the increasing need for data privacy, including the implementation of the `right to be forgotten'. The primary challenge in developing FU approaches lies in balancing the trade-offs in privacy, security, utility, and efficiency, as these elements often have competing requirements. Achieving an optimal equilibrium among these facets is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and usability of FL systems while adhering to privacy and security standards. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of existing FU methods, incorporating a detailed review of the various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we unify these diverse methods and metrics into an experimental framework. Additionally, the survey discusses potential future research directions in FU. Finally, a continually updated repository of related open-source materials is available at: https://github.com/abbottyanginchina/Awesome-Federated-Unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning at Scale via Lipschitz Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01401v2)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. Under such a definition, existing state-of-the-art methods are insufficient. Building on the concepts of Lipschitz continuity, we present a method that induces smoothing of the forget sample's output, with respect to perturbations of that sample. We show this smoothing successfully results in forgetting while preserving general model performance. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearnable Examples For Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02028v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable examples (UEs) refer to training samples modified to be unlearnable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These examples are usually generated by adding error-minimizing noises that can fool a DNN model into believing that there is nothing (no error) to learn from the data. The concept of UE has been proposed as a countermeasure against unauthorized data exploitation on personal data. While UE has been extensively studied on images, it is unclear how to craft effective UEs for time series data. In this work, we introduce the first UE generation method to protect time series data from unauthorized training by deep learning models. To this end, we propose a new form of error-minimizing noise that can be \emph{selectively} applied to specific segments of time series, rendering them unlearnable to DNN models while remaining imperceptible to human observers. Through extensive experiments on a wide range of time series datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed UE generation method is effective in both classification and generation tasks. It can protect time series data against unauthorized exploitation, while preserving their utility for legitimate usage, thereby contributing to the development of secure and trustworthy machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |

Challenges related to privacy and model efficiency arise from the use of outdated, private, and irrelevant data. These issues compromise both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of models in both Machine Learning and Unlearning. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRAMU). This framework incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms, privacy preservation techniques, and optimization strategies, making it a well-rounded solution for handling various data sources, either single-modality or multi-modality, while maintaining accuracy and privacy. FRAMU's strength lies in its adaptability to fluctuating data landscapes, its ability to unlearn outdated, private, or irrelevant data, and its support for continual model evolution without compromising privacy. Our experiments, conducted on both single-modality and multi-modality datasets, revealed that FRAMU significantly outperformed baseline models. Additional assessments of convergence behavior and optimization strategies further validate the framework's utility in federated learning applications. Overall, FRAMU advances Machine Unlearning by offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution that optimizes model performance while also addressing key challenges in dynamic data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Machine Unlearning for Image-to-Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00351v2)** | 2024-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning has emerged as a new paradigm to deliberately forget data samples from a given model in order to adhere to stringent regulations. However, existing machine unlearning methods have been primarily focused on classification models, leaving the landscape of unlearning for generative models relatively unexplored. This paper serves as a bridge, addressing the gap by providing a unifying framework of machine unlearning for image-to-image generative models. Within this framework, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm, underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, that demonstrates negligible performance degradation on the retain samples, while effectively removing the information from the forget samples. Empirical studies on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places-365, further show that our algorithm does not rely on the availability of the retain samples, which further complies with data retention policy. To our best knowledge, this work is the first that represents systemic, theoretical, empirical explorations of machine unlearning specifically tailored for image-to-image generative models. Our code is available at https://github.com/jpmorganchase/l2l-generator-unlearning.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |
| **[Unlearnable Algorithms for In-context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00751v1)** | 2024-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a desirable operation as models get increasingly deployed on data with unknown provenance. However, achieving exact unlearning -- obtaining a model that matches the model distribution when the data to be forgotten was never used -- is challenging or inefficient, often requiring significant retraining. In this paper, we focus on efficient unlearning methods for the task adaptation phase of a pretrained large language model (LLM). We observe that an LLM's ability to do in-context learning for task adaptation allows for efficient exact unlearning of task adaptation training data. We provide an algorithm for selecting few-shot training examples to prepend to the prompt given to an LLM (for task adaptation), ERASE, whose unlearning operation cost is independent of model and dataset size, meaning it scales to large models and datasets. We additionally compare our approach to fine-tuning approaches and discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches. This leads us to propose a new holistic measure of unlearning cost which accounts for varying inference costs, and conclude that in-context learning can often be more favourable than fine-tuning for deployments involving unlearning requests.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERASER: Machine Unlearning in MLaaS via an Inference Serving-Aware Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16136v2)** | 2024-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past years, Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) has received a surging demand for supporting Machine Learning-driven services to offer revolutionized user experience across diverse application areas. MLaaS provides inference service with low inference latency based on an ML model trained using a dataset collected from numerous individual data owners. Recently, for the sake of data owners' privacy and to comply with the "right to be forgotten (RTBF)" as enacted by data protection legislation, many machine unlearning methods have been proposed to remove data owners' data from trained models upon their unlearning requests. However, despite their promising efficiency, almost all existing machine unlearning methods handle unlearning requests independently from inference requests, which unfortunately introduces a new security issue of inference service obsolescence and a privacy vulnerability of undesirable exposure for machine unlearning in MLaaS. In this paper, we propose the ERASER framework for machinE unleaRning in MLaAS via an inferencE seRving-aware approach. ERASER strategically choose appropriate unlearning execution timing to address the inference service obsolescence issue. A novel inference consistency certification mechanism is proposed to avoid the violation of RTBF principle caused by postponed unlearning executions, thereby mitigating the undesirable exposure vulnerability. ERASER offers three groups of design choices to allow for tailor-made variants that best suit the specific environments and preferences of various MLaaS systems. Extensive empirical evaluations across various settings confirm ERASER's effectiveness, e.g., it can effectively save up to 99% of inference latency and 31% of computation overhead over the inference-oblivion baseline.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dataset Condensation Driven Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00195v1)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current trend in data regulation requirements and privacy-preserving machine learning has emphasized the importance of machine unlearning. The naive approach to unlearning training data by retraining over the complement of the forget samples is susceptible to computational challenges. These challenges have been effectively addressed through a collection of techniques falling under the umbrella of machine unlearning. However, there still exists a lack of sufficiency in handling persistent computational challenges in harmony with the utility and privacy of unlearned model. We attribute this to the lack of work on improving the computational complexity of approximate unlearning from the perspective of the training dataset. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by introducing dataset condensation as an essential component of machine unlearning in the context of image classification. To achieve this goal, we propose new dataset condensation techniques and an innovative unlearning scheme that strikes a balance between machine unlearning privacy, utility, and efficiency. Furthermore, we present a novel and effective approach to instrumenting machine unlearning and propose its application in defending against membership inference and model inversion attacks. Additionally, we explore a new application of our approach, which involves removing data from `condensed model', which can be employed to quickly train any arbitrary model without being influenced by unlearning samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game-Theoretic Unlearnable Example Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17523v1)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearnable example attacks are data poisoning attacks aiming to degrade the clean test accuracy of deep learning by adding imperceptible perturbations to the training samples, which can be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. However, directly solving this optimization problem is intractable for deep neural networks. In this paper, we investigate unlearnable example attacks from a game-theoretic perspective, by formulating the attack as a nonzero sum Stackelberg game. First, the existence of game equilibria is proved under the normal setting and the adversarial training setting. It is shown that the game equilibrium gives the most powerful poison attack in that the victim has the lowest test accuracy among all networks within the same hypothesis space, when certain loss functions are used. Second, we propose a novel attack method, called the Game Unlearnable Example (GUE), which has three main gradients. (1) The poisons are obtained by directly solving the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game with a first-order algorithm. (2) We employ an autoencoder-like generative network model as the poison attacker. (3) A novel payoff function is introduced to evaluate the performance of the poison. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GUE can effectively poison the model in various scenarios. Furthermore, the GUE still works by using a relatively small percentage of the training data to train the generator, and the poison generator can generalize to unseen data well. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/hong-xian/gue.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaMU: Disentangling Causal Effects in Deep Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17504v1)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning requires removing the information of forgetting data while keeping the necessary information of remaining data. Despite recent advancements in this area, existing methodologies mainly focus on the effect of removing forgetting data without considering the negative impact this can have on the information of the remaining data, resulting in significant performance degradation after data removal. Although some methods try to repair the performance of remaining data after removal, the forgotten information can also return after repair. Such an issue is due to the intricate intertwining of the forgetting and remaining data. Without adequately differentiating the influence of these two kinds of data on the model, existing algorithms take the risk of either inadequate removal of the forgetting data or unnecessary loss of valuable information from the remaining data. To address this shortcoming, the present study undertakes a causal analysis of the unlearning and introduces a novel framework termed Causal Machine Unlearning (CaMU). This framework adds intervention on the information of remaining data to disentangle the causal effects between forgetting data and remaining data. Then CaMU eliminates the causal impact associated with forgetting data while concurrently preserving the causal relevance of the remaining data. Comprehensive empirical results on various datasets and models suggest that CaMU enhances performance on the remaining data and effectively minimizes the influences of forgetting data. Notably, this work is the first to interpret deep model unlearning tasks from a new perspective of causality and provide a solution based on causal analysis, which opens up new possibilities for future research in deep model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper accepted for the SDM 24 conference</p></details> |

Consequently, given the extensive adoption of data-intensive machine learning (ML) algorithms and increasing concerns for personal data privacy protection, the concept of machine unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention. MU empowers an ML model to selectively eliminate sensitive or personally identifiable information it acquired during the training process. Evolving from the foundational principles of MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within the domain of federated learning (FL) settings. This empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client while preserving the integrity of the decentralized learning process. Nevertheless, unlike traditional MU, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges lead to the need for tailored design when designing FU algorithms. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques, methodologies, and recent advancements in federated unlearning. It provides an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluates existing federated unlearning algorithms, reviews optimizations tailored to federated learning, engages in discussions regarding practical applications, along with an assessment of their limitations, and outlines promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the federated unlearning process often introduces extensive storage overhead and consumes substantial computational resources, thus hindering its implementation in practice. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable federated unlearning framework based on isolated sharding and coded computing. We first divide distributed clients into multiple isolated shards across stages to reduce the number of clients being affected. Then, to reduce the storage overhead of the central server, we develop a coded computing mechanism by compressing the model parameters across different shards. In addition, we provide the theoretical analysis of time efficiency and storage effectiveness for the isolated and coded sharding. Finally, extensive experiments on two typical learning tasks, i.e., classification and generation, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve better performance than three state-of-the-art frameworks in terms of accuracy, retraining time, storage overhead, and F1 scores for resisting membership inference attacks.</p></details> |  |

It allows central servers to remove historical data effects within the machine learning model as well as address the "right to be forgotten" issue in federated learning. However, existing works require central servers to retain the historical model parameters from distributed clients, such that allows the central server to utilize these parameters for further training even, after the clients exit the training process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new blockchain-enabled trustworthy federated unlearning framework. We first design a proof of federated unlearning protocol, which utilizes the Chameleon hash function to verify data removal and eliminate the data contributions stored in other clients' models. Then, an adaptive contribution-based retraining mechanism is developed to reduce the computational overhead and significantly improve the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a better data removal effect than the state-of-the-art frameworks, marking a significant stride towards trustworthy federated unlearning.</p></details> |  |

Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac, which estimates the influence of a training dataset by unlearning it from the trained model. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. We empirically examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Experimental results demonstrate that our method estimates their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple model checkpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, under review</p></details> |

However, most existing graph unlearning strategies primarily rely on well-designed architectures or manual process, rendering them less user-friendly and posing challenges in terms of deployment efficiency. Furthermore, striking a balance between unlearning performance and framework generalization is also a pivotal concern. To address the above issues, we propose \underline{\textbf{M}}utual \underline{\textbf{E}}volution \underline{\textbf{G}}raph \underline{\textbf{U}}nlearning (MEGU), a new mutual evolution paradigm that simultaneously evolves the predictive and unlearning capacities of graph unlearning. By incorporating aforementioned two components, MEGU ensures complementary optimization in a unified training framework that aligns with the prediction and unlearning requirements. Extensive experiments on 9 graph benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MEGU in addressing unlearning requirements at the feature, node, and edge levels. Specifically, MEGU achieves average performance improvements of 2.7\%, 2.5\%, and 3.2\% across these three levels of unlearning tasks when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, MEGU exhibits satisfactory training efficiency, reducing time and space overhead by an average of 159.8x and 9.6x, respectively, in comparison to retraining GNN from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Communication Efficient and Provable Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11018v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study federated unlearning, a novel problem to eliminate the impact of specific clients or data points on the global model learned via federated learning (FL). This problem is driven by the right to be forgotten and the privacy challenges in FL. We introduce a new framework for exact federated unlearning that meets two essential criteria: \textit{communication efficiency} and \textit{exact unlearning provability}. To our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle both aspects coherently. We start by giving a rigorous definition of \textit{exact} federated unlearning, which guarantees that the unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without the deleted data. We then pinpoint the key property that enables fast exact federated unlearning: total variation (TV) stability, which measures the sensitivity of the model parameters to slight changes in the dataset. Leveraging this insight, we develop a TV-stable FL algorithm called \texttt{FATS}, which modifies the classical \texttt{\underline{F}ed\underline{A}vg} algorithm for \underline{T}V \underline{S}tability and employs local SGD with periodic averaging to lower the communication round. We also design efficient unlearning algorithms for \texttt{FATS} under two settings: client-level and sample-level unlearning. We provide theoretical guarantees for our learning and unlearning algorithms, proving that they achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models. We empirically validate our framework on 6 benchmark datasets, and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation cost, and unlearning efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Effectively and efficiently removing the unlearning samples without negatively impacting the overall model performance is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive unlearning framework, leveraging the concept of representation learning for more effective unlearning. It removes the influence of unlearning samples by contrasting their embeddings against the remaining samples so that they are pushed away from their original classes and pulled toward other classes. By directly optimizing the representation space, it effectively removes the influence of unlearning samples while maintaining the representations learned from the remaining samples. Experiments on a variety of datasets and models on both class unlearning and sample unlearning showed that contrastive unlearning achieves the best unlearning effects and efficiency with the lowest performance loss compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While parameter-efficient modules (PEMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in equipping models with new skills, leveraging PEMs for deficiency unlearning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a PEMs operation approach, namely Extraction-before-Subtraction (Ext-Sub), to enhance the truthfulness and detoxification of LLMs through the integration of ``expert'' PEM and ``anti-expert'' PEM. Remarkably, even anti-expert PEM possess valuable capabilities due to their proficiency in generating fabricated content, which necessitates language modeling and logical narrative competence. Rather than merely negating the parameters, our approach involves extracting and eliminating solely the deficiency capability within anti-expert PEM while preserving the general capabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of truthfulness and detoxification, we conduct extensive experiments on LLMs, encompassing additional abilities such as language modeling and mathematical reasoning. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively improves truthfulness and detoxification, while largely preserving the fundamental abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2024; The first two authors contributed equally to this paper</p></details> |

Federated Learning (FL) is frequently utilized to build a global HAR model by aggregating user contributions without transmitting raw individual data. Despite substantial progress in user privacy protection with FL, challenges persist. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) empower users to request data removal, raising a new query in FL: How can a HAR client request data removal without compromising other clients' privacy? In response, we propose a lightweight machine unlearning method for refining the FL HAR model by selectively removing a portion of a client's training data. Our method employs a third-party dataset unrelated to model training. Using KL divergence as a loss function for fine-tuning, we aim to align the predicted probability distribution on forgotten data with the third-party dataset. Additionally, we introduce a membership inference evaluation method to assess unlearning effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse datasets show our method achieves unlearning accuracy comparable to \textit{retraining} methods, resulting in speedups ranging from hundreds to thousands.</p></details> |  |

In response to this critical need, we introduce a novel approach called Attack-and-Reset for Unlearning (ARU). This algorithm leverages meticulously crafted adversarial noise to generate a parameter mask, effectively resetting certain parameters and rendering them unlearnable. ARU outperforms current state-of-the-art results on two facial machine-unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC. In particular, we present the steps involved in attacking and masking that strategically filter and re-initialize network parameters biased towards the forget set. Our work represents a significant advancement in rendering data unexploitable to deep learning models through parameter re-initialization, achieved by harnessing adversarial noise to craft a mask.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Unlearn: Instance-wise Unlearning for Pre-trained Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11578v3)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the recent advent of regulations for data protection (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation), there has been increasing demand in deleting information learned from sensitive data in pre-trained models without retraining from scratch. The inherent vulnerability of neural networks towards adversarial attacks and unfairness also calls for a robust method to remove or correct information in an instance-wise fashion, while retaining the predictive performance across remaining data. To this end, we consider instance-wise unlearning, of which the goal is to delete information on a set of instances from a pre-trained model, by either misclassifying each instance away from its original prediction or relabeling the instance to a different label. We also propose two methods that reduce forgetting on the remaining data: 1) utilizing adversarial examples to overcome forgetting at the representation-level and 2) leveraging weight importance metrics to pinpoint network parameters guilty of propagating unwanted information. Both methods only require the pre-trained model and data instances to forget, allowing painless application to real-life settings where the entire training set is unavailable. Through extensive experimentation on various image classification benchmarks, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning given instances in both single-task and continual unlearning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2024 camera ready version</p></details> |

Exposing Vulnerabilities in Machine Unlearning Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08230v2)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The right to be forgotten requires the removal or "unlearning" of a user's data from machine learning models. However, in the context of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), retraining a model from scratch to fulfill the unlearning request is impractical due to the lack of training data on the service provider's side (the server). Furthermore, approximate unlearning further embraces a complex trade-off between utility (model performance) and privacy (unlearning performance). In this paper, we try to explore the potential threats posed by unlearning services in MLaaS, specifically over-unlearning, where more information is unlearned than expected. We propose two strategies that leverage over-unlearning to measure the impact on the trade-off balancing, under black-box access settings, in which the existing machine unlearning attacks are not applicable. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, across various model architectures and representative unlearning approaches. Results indicate significant potential for both strategies to undermine model efficacy in unlearning scenarios. This study uncovers an underexplored gap between unlearning and contemporary MLaaS, highlighting the need for careful considerations in balancing data unlearning, model utility, and security.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2024, San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |

Unlearning, or tuning models to forget information present in their training data, provides us with a way to protect private data after training. Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place. To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning. We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning. We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy. Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms. Importantly, none of the baselines we consider show effective unlearning motivating continued efforts to develop approaches for unlearning that effectively tune models so that they truly behave as if they were never trained on the forget data at all.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://locuslab.github.io/tofu/</p></details> |
| **[To Be Forgotten or To Be Fair: Unveiling Fairness Implications of Machine Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03350v2)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The right to be forgotten (RTBF) is motivated by the desire of people not to be perpetually disadvantaged by their past deeds. For this, data deletion needs to be deep and permanent, and should be removed from machine learning models. Researchers have proposed machine unlearning algorithms which aim to erase specific data from trained models more efficiently. However, these methods modify how data is fed into the model and how training is done, which may subsequently compromise AI ethics from the fairness perspective. To help software engineers make responsible decisions when adopting these unlearning methods, we present the first study on machine unlearning methods to reveal their fairness implications. We designed and conducted experiments on two typical machine unlearning methods (SISA and AmnesiacML) along with a retraining method (ORTR) as baseline using three fairness datasets under three different deletion strategies. Experimental results show that under non-uniform data deletion, SISA leads to better fairness compared with ORTR and AmnesiacML, while initial training and uniform data deletion do not necessarily affect the fairness of all three methods. These findings have exposed an important research problem in software engineering, and can help practitioners better understand the potential trade-offs on fairness when considering solutions for RTBF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI Spring Symposium on AI Trustworthiness Assessment 2023.

| **[PosCUDA: Position based Convolution for Unlearnable Audio Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02135v1)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models require large amounts of clean data to acheive good performance. To avoid the cost of expensive data acquisition, researchers use the abundant data available on the internet. This raises significant privacy concerns on the potential misuse of personal data for model training without authorisation. Recent works such as CUDA propose solutions to this problem by adding class-wise blurs to make datasets unlearnable, i.e a model can never use the acquired dataset for learning. However these methods often reduce the quality of the data making it useless for practical applications. We introduce PosCUDA, a position based convolution for creating unlearnable audio datasets. PosCUDA uses class-wise convolutions on small patches of audio. The location of the patches are based on a private key for each class, hence the model learns the relations between positional blurs and labels, while failing to generalize. We empirically show that PosCUDA can achieve unlearnability while maintaining the quality of the original audio datasets. Our proposed method is also robust to different audio feature representations such as MFCC, raw audio and different architectures such as transformers, convolutional networks etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[eCIL-MU: Embedding based Class Incremental Learning and Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02457v1)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New categories may be introduced over time, or existing categories may need to be reclassified. Class incremental learning (CIL) is employed for the gradual acquisition of knowledge about new categories while preserving information about previously learned ones in such dynamic environments. It might also be necessary to also eliminate the influence of related categories on the model to adapt to reclassification. We thus introduce class-level machine unlearning (MU) within CIL. Typically, MU methods tend to be time-consuming and can potentially harm the model's performance. A continuous stream of unlearning requests could lead to catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a non-destructive eCIL-MU framework based on embedding techniques to map data into vectors and then be stored in vector databases. Our approach exploits the overlap between CIL and MU tasks for acceleration. Experiments demonstrate the capability of achieving unlearning effectiveness and orders of magnitude (upto $\sim 278\times$) of acceleration.</p></details> |  |

Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

| **[Layer Attack Unlearning: Fast and Accurate Machine Unlearning via Layer Level Attack and Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16823v1)** | 2023-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, serious concerns have been raised about the privacy issues related to training datasets in machine learning algorithms when including personal data. Various regulations in different countries, including the GDPR grant individuals to have personal data erased, known as 'the right to be forgotten' or 'the right to erasure'. However, there has been less research on effectively and practically deleting the requested personal data from the training set while not jeopardizing the overall machine learning performance. In this work, we propose a fast and novel machine unlearning paradigm at the layer level called layer attack unlearning, which is highly accurate and fast compared to existing machine unlearning algorithms. We introduce the Partial-PGD algorithm to locate the samples to forget efficiently. In addition, we only use the last layer of the model inspired by the Forward-Forward algorithm for unlearning process. Lastly, we use Knowledge Distillation (KD) to reliably learn the decision boundaries from the teacher using soft label information to improve accuracy performance. We conducted extensive experiments with SOTA machine unlearning models and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for accuracy and end-to-end unlearning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Machine Unlearning Benchmarks: Forgetting the Personal Identities in Facial Recognition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02240v2)** | 2023-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a crucial tool for enabling a classification model to forget specific data that are used in the training time. Recently, various studies have presented machine unlearning algorithms and evaluated their methods on several datasets. However, most of the current machine unlearning algorithms have been evaluated solely on traditional computer vision datasets such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, and SVHN. Furthermore, previous studies generally evaluate the unlearning methods in the class-unlearning setup. Most previous work first trains the classification models and then evaluates the machine unlearning performance of machine unlearning algorithms by forgetting selected image classes (categories) in the experiments. Unfortunately, these class-unlearning settings might not generalize to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a machine unlearning setting that aims to unlearn specific instance that contains personal privacy (identity) while maintaining the original task of a given model. Specifically, we propose two machine unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC, that are greatly useful to evaluate the performance and robustness of a machine unlearning algorithm. In our benchmark datasets, the original model performs facial feature recognition tasks: face age estimation (multi-class classification) and facial attribute classification (binary class classification), where a class does not depend on any single target subject (personal identity), which can be a realistic setting. Moreover, we also report the performance of the state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods on our proposed benchmark datasets. All the datasets, source codes, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ndb796/MachineUnlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AAAI 2024 Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence (PPAI)</p></details> |

| **[Generative Representational Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09906v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss. Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by > 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models. Models, code, etc. are freely available at https://github.com/ContextualAI/gritlm.</p></details> | <details><summary>66 pa...</summary><p>66 pages (16 main), 25 figures, 34 tables</p></details> |
| **[Qilin-Med: Multi-stage Knowledge Injection Advanced Medical Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09089v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds great potential but faces challenges. Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam. These results highlight the contribution of our novel training approach in building LLMs for medical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position Engineering: Boosting Large Language Models through Positional Information Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11216v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10981v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) merges retrieval methods with deep learning advancements to address the static limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling the dynamic integration of up-to-date external information. This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. By offering an organized framework and categorization, the study aims to consolidate existing research on RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings, and highlight its potential to broaden the adaptability and applications of LLMs.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning and Professional Question Answering Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17887v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable potential in medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering. However, LLMs can potentially hallucinate and yield factually incorrect outcomes, even with domain-specific pretraining. Previously, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has limited success in addressing hallucinations. Unlike previous methods in RAG where the retrieval model was trained separately from the LLM, we introduce JMLR (for Jointly trains LLM and information Retrieval (IR)) during the fine-tuning phase. The synchronized training mechanism enhances JMLR's ability to retrieve clinical guidelines and leverage medical knowledge to reason and answer questions and reduces the demand for computational resources. We evaluated JMLR on the important medical question answering application. Our experimental results demonstrate that JMLR-13B (70.5%) outperforms a previous state-of-the-art open-source model using conventional pre-training and fine-tuning Meditron-70B (68.9%) and Llama2-13B with RAG (54.9%) on a medical question-answering dataset. JMLR-13B (148 GPU hours) also trains much faster than Meditron-70B (42630 GPU hours). Through this work, we provide a new and efficient knowledge enhancement tool for healthcare, demonstrating the potential of integrating IR and LLM training for medical question-answering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Is Dense Passage Retrieval Retrieving?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11035v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense passage retrieval (DPR) is the first step in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLM). DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenTKG: Generative Forecasting on Temporal Knowledge Graph with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07793v5)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have ignited interest in the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional embedding-based and rule-based methods dominate. The question remains open of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational data and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational forecasting. Therefore, we bring temporal knowledge forecasting into the generative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between complex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs can handle, and between the enormous data sizes of tKGs and heavy computation costs of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework named GenTKG combining a temporal logical rule-based retrieval strategy and few-shot parameter-efficient instruction tuning to solve the above challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments have shown that GenTKG outperforms conventional methods of temporal relational forecasting with low computation resources using extremely limited training data as few as 16 samples. GenTKG also highlights remarkable cross-domain generalizability with outperforming performance on unseen datasets without re-training, and in-domain generalizability regardless of time split in the same dataset. Our work reveals the huge potential of LLMs in the tKG domain and opens a new frontier for generative forecasting on tKGs. Code and data are released here: https://github.com/mayhugotong/GenTKG.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Findings of NAACL 2024, Spotlight on TGL@NeurIPS2023</p></details> |

Current approaches to this kind of "fact-checking" are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to LLMs to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify pre-existing datasets into a benchmark LLM-AggreFact, collected from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations. Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy. We release LLM-AggreFact, code for data synthesis, and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM-A...</summary><p>LLM-AggreFact benchmark, MiniCheck models, data generation code at https://github.com/Liyan06/MiniCheck</p></details> |

In this chapter, we consider generative information retrieval evaluation from two distinct but interrelated perspectives. First, large language models (LLMs) themselves are rapidly becoming tools for evaluation, with current research indicating that LLMs may be superior to crowdsource workers and other paid assessors on basic relevance judgement tasks. We review past and ongoing related research, including speculation on the future of shared task initiatives, such as TREC, and a discussion on the continuing need for human assessments. Second, we consider the evaluation of emerging LLM-based generative information retrieval (GenIR) systems, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. We consider approaches that focus both on the end-to-end evaluation of GenIR systems and on the evaluation of a retrieval component as an element in a RAG system. Going forward, we expect the evaluation of GenIR systems to be at least partially based on LLM-based assessment, creating an apparent circularity, with a system seemingly evaluating its own output. We resolve this apparent circularity in two ways: 1) by viewing LLM-based assessment as a form of "slow search", where a slower IR system is used for evaluation and training of a faster production IR system; and 2) by recognizing a continuing need to ground evaluation in human assessment, even if the characteristics of that human assessment must change.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft of a chapter intended to appear in a forthcoming book on generative information retrieval, co-edited by Chirag Shah and Ryen White</p></details> |
| **[DP-RDM: Adapting Diffusion Models to Private Domains Without Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14421v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to suffer from sample-level memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees. For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.</p></details> |  |

However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital "Spiral of Silence" effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.</p></details> |  |

Quantifying the tug-of-war between RAG and LLMs' internal prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10198v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is often used to fix hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs). However, in cases when the LLM alone incorrectly answers a question, does providing the correct retrieved content always fix the error? Conversely, in cases where the retrieved content is incorrect, does the LLM know to ignore the wrong information, or does it recapitulate the error? To answer these questions, we systematically analyze the tug-of-war between a LLM's internal knowledge (i.e. its prior) and the retrieved information in settings when they disagree. We test GPT-4 and other LLMs on question-answering abilities across datasets with and without reference documents. As expected, providing the correct retrieved information fixes most model mistakes (94% accuracy). However, when the reference document is perturbed with increasing levels of wrong values, the LLM is more likely to recite the incorrect, modified information when its internal prior is weaker but is more resistant when its prior is stronger. Similarly, we also find that the more the modified information deviates from the model's prior, the less likely the model is to prefer it. These results highlight an underlying tension between a model's prior knowledge and the information presented in reference documents.</p></details> |  |

However, when a reader seeks additional information, not present in the abstract, they face a costly cognitive chasm during their dive into the full text. To bridge this gap, we introduce recursively expandable abstracts, a novel interaction paradigm that dynamically expands abstracts by progressively incorporating additional information from the papers' full text. This lightweight interaction allows scholars to specify their information needs by quickly brushing over the abstract or selecting AI-suggested expandable entities.

| **[README: Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient Education through Data-Centric NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15561v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement in healthcare has shifted focus toward patient-centric approaches, particularly in self-care and patient education, facilitated by access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, medical jargon in EHRs poses significant challenges in patient comprehension. To address this, we introduce a new task of automatically generating lay definitions, aiming to simplify complex medical terms into patient-friendly lay language. We first created the README dataset, an extensive collection of over 50,000 unique (medical term, lay definition) pairs and 300,000 mentions, each offering context-aware lay definitions manually annotated by domain experts. We have also engineered a data-centric Human-AI pipeline that synergizes data filtering, augmentation, and selection to improve data quality. We then used README as the training data for models and leveraged a Retrieval-Augmented Generation method to reduce hallucinations and improve the quality of model outputs. Our extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that open-source mobile-friendly models, when fine-tuned with high-quality data, are capable of matching or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models like ChatGPT. This research represents a significant stride in closing the knowledge gap in patient education and advancing patient-centric healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries. Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education. Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day. Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc. Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Despite its notable successes, AIGC still faces hurdles such as updating knowledge, handling long-tail data, mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for future research.

However, the large-scale development of satellite communication networks is constrained by the complex system models, whose modeling is challenging for massive users. Moreover, transmission interference between satellites and users seriously affects communication performance. To solve these problems, this paper develops generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents for model formulation and then applies a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to design transmission strategies. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build an interactive modeling paradigm and utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract satellite expert knowledge that supports mathematical modeling. Afterward, by integrating the expertise of multiple specialized components, we propose an MoE-proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach to solve the formulated problem. Each expert can optimize the optimization variables at which it excels through specialized training through its own network and then aggregates them through the gating network to perform joint optimization. The simulation results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of employing a generative agent for problem formulation. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed MoE-ppo approach over other benchmarks is confirmed in solving the formulated problem. The adaptability of MoE-PPO to various customized modeling problems has also been demonstrated.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we study generative artificial intelligence (AI) agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design, from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems.

We present a data-driven method to identify explicit facts of the form - head entity :: relationship :: tail entity from patented artefact descriptions. We train roBERTa Transformer-based sequence classification models using our proprietary dataset of 44,227 sentences. Upon classifying tokens in a sentence as entities or relationships, our method uses another classifier to identify specific relationship tokens for a given pair of entities. We compare the performances against linear classifiers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that both incorporate BERT Transformer-based token embeddings to predict associations among the entities and relationships. We apply our method to 4,870 fan system related patents and populate a knowledge base that constitutes around 3 million facts. Using the knowledge base, we demonstrate retrieving generalisable and specific domain knowledge for contextualising LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLM) have taken the world by storm, without eliminating or at least reducing hallucinations, real-world GenAI systems may face challenges in user adoption. In the process of deploying an enterprise application that produces workflows based on natural language requirements, we devised a system leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to greatly improve the quality of the structured output that represents such workflows. Thanks to our implementation of RAG, our proposed system significantly reduces hallucinations in the output and improves the generalization of our LLM in out-of-domain settings. In addition, we show that using a small, well-trained retriever encoder can reduce the size of the accompanying LLM, thereby making deployments of LLM-based systems less resource-intensive.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at NAACL 2024. 11 pages and 4 figures</p></details> |

Despite their progress, existing text-to-vis models often heavily rely on lexical matching between words in the questions and tokens in data schemas. This overreliance on lexical matching may lead to a diminished level of model robustness against input variations. In this study, we thoroughly examine the robustness of current text-to-vis models, an area that has not previously been explored. In particular, we construct the first robustness dataset nvBench-Rob, which contains diverse lexical and phrasal variations based on the original text-to-vis benchmark nvBench. Then, we found that the performance of existing text-to-vis models on this new dataset dramatically drops, implying that these methods exhibit inadequate robustness overall. Finally, we propose a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, named GRED, specifically designed to address input perturbations in these two variants. The framework consists of three parts: NLQ-Retrieval Generator, Visualization Query-Retrieval Retuner and Annotation-based Debugger, which are used to tackle the challenges posed by natural language variants, programming style differences and data schema variants, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model RGVisNet in the Text-to-Vis field, GRED performs better in terms of model robustness, with a 32% increase in accuracy on the proposed nvBench-Rob dataset.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the application of LLMs in the medical domain by exploring strategies to enhance their performance for the Named-Entity Recognition (NER) task. Specifically, our study reveals the importance of meticulously designed prompts in biomedicine. Strategic selection of in-context examples yields a notable improvement, showcasing ~15-20\% increase in F1 score across all benchmark datasets for few-shot clinical NER. Additionally, our findings suggest that integrating external resources through prompting strategies can bridge the gap between general-purpose LLM proficiency and the specialized demands of medical NER. Leveraging a medical knowledge base, our proposed method inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can boost the F1 score of LLMs for zero-shot clinical NER. We will release the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking LLMs & Alignment Algorithms for Time-Sensitive Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08700v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the appropriateness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as knowledge repositories. We focus on the challenge of maintaining LLMs' factual knowledge up-to-date over time. Motivated by the lack of studies on identifying outdated knowledge within LLMs, we design and develop a dynamic benchmark with up-to-date ground truth answers for each target factual question. We evaluate eighteen open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on time-sensitive knowledge retrieved in real-time from Wikidata. We select time-sensitive domain facts in politics, sports, and organizations, and estimate the recency of the information learned by the model during pre-training\fine-tuning. In the second contribution, we evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for aligning LLMs with up-to-date factual knowledge and compare their performance with Retrieval Augmented Generation. The dynamic benchmark is designed to be used as-is to assess LLMs's up-to-dateness, as well as to be extended to other domains by sharing the code, the dataset, as well as evaluation and visualization scripts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superposition Prompting: Improving and Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06910v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts. Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs without the need for fine-tuning. At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel prompt paths, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant. We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on. For example, our approach facilitates an 93x reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43\% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes. In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility. To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG. Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models' capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively understand and utilize credibility for generation, significantly outperform other models with retrieval augmentation, and exhibit resilience against the disruption caused by noisy documents, thereby maintaining robust performance. Moreover, our model supports customized credibility, offering a wide range of potential applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, benchmark, and models are available at https://github.com/panruotong/CAG</p></details> |

Despite this fact, most EHR systems still rely on keyword-based searches. With the advent of generative large language models (LLMs), retrieving information can lead to better search and summarization capabilities. Such retrievers can also feed Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to answer any query. However, the task of retrieving information from EHR real-world clinical data contained within EHR systems in order to solve several downstream use cases is challenging due to the difficulty in creating query-document support pairs. We provide a blueprint for creating such datasets in an affordable manner using large language models. Our method results in a retriever that is 30-50 F-1 points better than propriety counterparts such as Ada and Mistral for oncology data elements. We further compare our model, called Onco-Retriever, against fine-tuned PubMedBERT model as well. We conduct an extensive manual evaluation on real-world EHR data along with latency analysis of the different models and provide a path forward for healthcare organizations to build domain-specific retrievers.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[A Comparison of Methods for Evaluating Generative IR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04044v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information retrieval systems increasingly incorporate generative components. For example, in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, a retrieval component might provide a source of ground truth, while a generative component summarizes and augments its responses. In other systems, a large language model (LLM) might directly generate responses without consulting a retrieval component. While there are multiple definitions of generative information retrieval (Gen-IR) systems, in this paper we focus on those systems where the system's response is not drawn from a fixed collection of documents or passages. The response to a query may be entirely new text. Since traditional IR evaluation methods break down under this model, we explore various methods that extend traditional offline evaluation approaches to the Gen-IR context. Offline IR evaluation traditionally employs paid human assessors, but increasingly LLMs are replacing human assessment, demonstrating capabilities similar or superior to crowdsourced labels. Given that Gen-IR systems do not generate responses from a fixed set, we assume that methods for Gen-IR evaluation must largely depend on LLM-generated labels. Along with methods based on binary and graded relevance, we explore methods based on explicit subtopics, pairwise preferences, and embeddings. We first validate these methods against human assessments on several TREC Deep Learning Track tasks; we then apply these methods to evaluate the output of several purely generative systems. For each method we consider both its ability to act autonomously, without the need for human labels or other input, and its ability to support human auditing. To trust these methods, we must be assured that their results align with human assessments. In order to do so, evaluation criteria must be transparent, so that outcomes can be audited by human assessors.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAR-b: Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06347v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic textual similartiy (STS) and information retrieval tasks (IR) tasks have been the two major avenues to record the progress of embedding models in the past few years. Under the emerging Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm, we envision the need to evaluate next-level language understanding abilities of embedding models, and take a conscious look at the reasoning abilities stored in them. Addressing this, we pose the question: Can retrievers solve reasoning problems? By transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks, we find that without specifically trained for reasoning-level language understanding, current state-of-the-art retriever models may still be far from being competent for playing the role of assisting LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. Moreover, albeit trained to be aware of instructions, instruction-aware IR models are often better off without instructions in inference time for reasoning tasks, posing an overlooked retriever-LLM behavioral gap for the research community to align. However, recent decoder-based embedding models show great promise in narrowing the gap, highlighting the pathway for embedding models to achieve reasoning-level language understanding. We also show that, although current off-the-shelf re-ranker models fail on these tasks, injecting reasoning abilities into them through fine-tuning still appears easier than doing so to bi-encoders, and we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks by fine-tuning a reranking model. We release Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark (RAR-b), a holistic suite of tasks and settings to evaluate the reasoning abilities stored in retriever models. RAR-b is available at https://github.com/gowitheflow-1998/RAR-b.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the benefits of reducing vector database dimensions, with a focus on computational efficiency and overcoming the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to dimensionality reduction, a method previously underexploited in this context. By demonstrating its utility across various AI domains, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and image processing, this FFT-based approach promises to improve data retrieval processes and enhance the efficiency and scalability of AI solutions. The incorporation of FFT may not only optimize operations in real-time processing and recommendation systems but also extend to advanced image processing techniques, where dimensionality reduction can significantly improve performance and analysis efficiency. This paper advocates for the broader adoption of FFT in vector database management, marking a significant stride towards addressing the challenges of data volume and complexity in AI research and applications. Unlike many existing approaches, we directly handle the embedding vectors produced by the model after processing a test input.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Despite it claims to save memory usage by loading compressed vectors by product quantization (PQ), its memory usage increases in proportion to the scale of datasets. In this paper, we propose All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization (AiSAQ), which offloads the compressed vectors to storage. Our method achieves $\sim$10 MB memory usage in query search even with billion-scale datasets with minor performance degradation. AiSAQ also reduces the index load time before query search, which enables the index switch between muitiple billion-scale datasets and significantly enhances the flexibility of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This method is applicable to all graph-based ANNS algorithms and can be combined with higher-spec ANNS methods in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have focused on extracting and verifying atomic facts from these texts via prompting LM evaluators. However, we demonstrate that this method of prompting is unreliable when faced with incomplete or inaccurate reference information. We introduce Facts as a Function (FaaF), a new approach to the fact verification task that leverages the function-calling capabilities of LMs. FaaF significantly enhances the ability of LMs to identify unsupported facts in texts, while also improving efficiency and significantly lowering costs compared to prompt-based methods. Additionally, we propose a framework for evaluating factual recall in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which we employ to compare prompt-based and FaaF methods using various LMs under challenging conditions.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

Existing analyses often fall short in providing disentangled (model-centric) insights into LM semantics, and neglect essential aspects of LM adaptation. In response, we introduce a pioneering method called vocabulary-defined semantics, which establishes a reference frame within the LM latent space, ensuring disentangled semantic analysis grounded in LM vocabulary. Our approach transcends prior entangled analysis, leveraging LM vocabulary for model-centric insights. Furthermore, we propose a novel technique to compute logits, emphasising differentiability and local isotropy, and introduce a neural clustering module for semantically calibrating data representations during LM adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse text understanding datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods of retrieval-augmented generation and parameter-efficient finetuning, showcasing its efficacy and broad applicability. Our findings not only shed light on LM mechanics, but also offer practical solutions to enhance LM performance and interpretability.</p></details> | under peer-review |

However, there is still a lack of exploration regarding the optimal approach for incorporating retrieved passages into the answer generation process. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating different methods of combining retrieved passages with LLMs to enhance answer generation. We begin by examining the limitations of a commonly-used concatenation approach. Surprisingly, this approach often results in generating "unknown" outputs, even when the correct document is among the top-k retrieved passages. To address this issue, we explore four alternative strategies for integrating the retrieved passages with the LLMs. These strategies include two single-round methods that utilize chain-of-thought reasoning and two multi-round strategies that incorporate feedback loops. Through comprehensive analyses and experiments, we provide insightful observations on how to effectively leverage retrieved passages to enhance the answer generation capability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[FairRAG: Fair Human Generation via Fair Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19964v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-to-image generative models reflect or even amplify societal biases ingrained in their training data. This is especially concerning for human image generation where models are biased against certain demographic groups. Existing attempts to rectify this issue are hindered by the inherent limitations of the pre-trained models and fail to substantially improve demographic diversity. In this work, we introduce Fair Retrieval Augmented Generation (FairRAG), a novel framework that conditions pre-trained generative models on reference images retrieved from an external image database to improve fairness in human generation. FairRAG enables conditioning through a lightweight linear module that projects reference images into the textual space. To enhance fairness, FairRAG applies simple-yet-effective debiasing strategies, providing images from diverse demographic groups during the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairRAG outperforms existing methods in terms of demographic diversity, image-text alignment, and image fidelity while incurring minimal computational overhead during inference.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[TRAQ: Trustworthy Retrieval Augmented Question Answering via Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04642v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applied to open-domain question answering, large language models (LLMs) frequently generate incorrect responses based on made-up facts, which are called $\textit{hallucinations}$. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy to avoid hallucinations, but it does not provide guarantees on its correctness. To address this challenge, we propose the Trustworthy Retrieval Augmented Question Answering, or $\textit{TRAQ}$, which provides the first end-to-end statistical correctness guarantee for RAG. TRAQ uses conformal prediction, a statistical technique for constructing prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the semantically correct response with high probability. Additionally, TRAQ leverages Bayesian optimization to minimize the size of the constructed sets. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that TRAQ provides the desired correctness guarantee while reducing prediction set size by 16.2% on average compared to an ablation. The implementation is available at $\href{https://github.com/shuoli90/TRAQ.git}{TRAQ}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 17 figures, 2024 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics</p></details> |

However, the applications of LLMs for information comparisons face scalability challenges due to the difficulties in maintaining information across large contexts and overcoming model token limitations. To address these challenges, we developed the novel Abstractive Summarization \& Criteria-driven Comparison Endpoint (ASC$^2$End) system to automate information comparison at scale. Our system employs Semantic Text Similarity comparisons for generating evidence-supported analyses. We utilize proven data-handling strategies such as abstractive summarization and retrieval augmented generation to overcome token limitations and retain relevant information during model inference. Prompts were designed using zero-shot strategies to contextualize information for improved model reasoning. We evaluated abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring and assessed the generated comparison quality using survey responses. Models evaluated on the ASC$^2$End system show desirable results providing insights on the expected performance of the system. ASC$^2$End is a novel system and tool that enables accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains, overcoming limitations in context length and retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. To address this problem, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

This is beneficial for knowledge-intensive and expert reliant tasks, including legal question-answering, which require evidence to validate generated text outputs. We highlight that Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) presents key opportunities to structure retrieval as part of the RAG process in an LLM. We introduce CBR-RAG, where CBR cycle's initial retrieval stage, its indexing vocabulary, and similarity knowledge containers are used to enhance LLM queries with contextually relevant cases. This integration augments the original LLM query, providing a richer prompt. We present an evaluation of CBR-RAG, and examine different representations (i.e. general and domain-specific embeddings) and methods of comparison (i.e. inter, intra and hybrid similarity) on the task of legal question-answering. Our results indicate that the context provided by CBR's case reuse enforces similarity between relevant components of the questions and the evidence base leading to significant improvements in the quality of generated answers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCBR'24</p></details> |

This study proposes Chemist-X, a transformative AI agent that automates the reaction condition recommendation (RCR) task in chemical synthesis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. To emulate expert chemists' strategies when solving RCR tasks, Chemist-X utilizes advanced RAG schemes to interrogate online molecular databases and distill critical data from the latest literature database. Further, the agent leverages state-of-the-art computer-aided design (CAD) tools with a large language model (LLM) supervised programming interface. With the ability to utilize updated chemical knowledge and CAD tools, our agent significantly outperforms conventional synthesis AIs confined to the fixed knowledge within its training data. Chemist-X considerably reduces chemists' workload and allows them to focus on more fundamental and creative problems, thereby bringing closer computational techniques and chemical research and making a remarkable leap toward harnessing AI's full capabilities in scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[CONFLARE: CONFormal LArge language model REtrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04287v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks enable large language models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and incorporate it into the context for generating responses. This mitigates hallucinations and allows for the updating of knowledge without retraining the LLM. However, RAG does not guarantee valid responses if retrieval fails to identify the necessary information as the context for response generation. Also, if there is contradictory content, the RAG response will likely reflect only one of the two possible responses. Therefore, quantifying uncertainty in the retrieval process is crucial for ensuring RAG trustworthiness. In this report, we introduce a four-step framework for applying conformal prediction to quantify retrieval uncertainty in RAG frameworks. First, a calibration set of questions answerable from the knowledge base is constructed. Each question's embedding is compared against document embeddings to identify the most relevant document chunks containing the answer and record their similarity scores. Given a user-specified error rate ({\alpha}), these similarity scores are then analyzed to determine a similarity score cutoff threshold. During inference, all chunks with similarity exceeding this threshold are retrieved to provide context to the LLM, ensuring the true answer is captured in the context with a (1-{\alpha}) confidence level. We provide a Python package that enables users to implement the entire workflow proposed in our work, only using LLMs and without human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github code: https://github.com/Mayo-Radiology-Informatics-Lab/conflare</p></details> |

In this vision paper, we introduce CompliAT, a pioneering framework designed to streamline the compliance process of AT product specifications with these standards through the innovative use of Large Language Models (LLMs). CompliAT addresses three critical tasks: checking terminology consistency, classifying products according to standards, and tracing key product specifications to standard requirements. We tackle the challenge of terminology consistency to ensure that the language used in product specifications aligns with relevant standards, reducing misunderstandings and non-compliance risks. We propose a novel approach for product classification, leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation model to accurately categorize AT products aligning to international standards, despite the sparse availability of training data. Finally, CompliAT implements a traceability and compliance mechanism from key product specifications to standard requirements, ensuring all aspects of an AT product are thoroughly vetted against the corresponding standards. By semi-automating these processes, CompliAT aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for AT product standards compliance and uphold quality and safety standards. We outline our planned implementation and evaluation plan for CompliAT.</p></details> |  |

Building upon this benchmark, we investigate how different prompting methods enhance LLMs' performance on this task to reveal their inherent power for outside-the-box thinking ability. Through participating in SemEval-2024, task 9, Sentence Puzzle sub-task, we explore prompt engineering methods: chain of thoughts (CoT) and direct prompting, enhancing with informative descriptions, and employing contextualizing prompts using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our experiments involve three LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Zephyr-7B-beta. We generate a dataset of thinking paths between riddles and options using GPT-4, validated by humans for quality. Findings indicate that compressed informative prompts enhance performance. Dynamic in-context learning enhances model performance significantly. Furthermore, fine-tuning Zephyr on our dataset enhances performance across other commonsense datasets, underscoring the value of innovative thinking.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, Proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2024) @ NAACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> |  |

It is preferable that successful RAG systems provide accurate answers that are supported by being grounded in a passage without any hallucinations. While considerable work is required for building a full RAG pipeline, being able to benchmark performance is also necessary. We present ClapNQ, a benchmark Long-form Question Answering dataset for the full RAG pipeline. ClapNQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The ClapNQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, with multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous. RAG models must adapt to these properties to be successful at ClapNQ. We present baseline experiments and analysis for ClapNQ that highlight areas where there is still significant room for improvement in grounded RAG.

Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to covering longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder language model that effectively encodes contexts, and the encoding applies cross-attention with origin inputs. With our method, the origin language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that after fine-tuning, there is improved performance across two held-in datasets, four held-out datasets, and also in two In Context Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

While the literature on RAG is growing, it primarily focuses on systematic reviews and comparisons of new state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques against their predecessors, with a gap in extensive experimental comparisons. This study begins to address this gap by assessing various RAG methods' impacts on retrieval precision and answer similarity. We found that Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) and LLM reranking significantly enhance retrieval precision. However, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Cohere rerank did not exhibit notable advantages over a baseline Naive RAG system, and Multi-query approaches underperformed. Sentence Window Retrieval emerged as the most effective for retrieval precision, despite its variable performance on answer similarity. The study confirms the potential of the Document Summary Index as a competent retrieval approach. All resources related to this research are publicly accessible for further investigation through our GitHub repository ARAGOG (https://github.com/predlico/ARAGOG).

We introduce ARES, an Automated RAG Evaluation System, for evaluating RAG systems along the dimensions of context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the quality of individual RAG components. To mitigate potential prediction errors, ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated datapoints for prediction-powered inference (PPI). Across eight different knowledge-intensive tasks in KILT, SuperGLUE, and AIS, ARES accurately evaluates RAG systems while using only a few hundred human annotations during evaluation. Furthermore, ARES judges remain effective across domain shifts, proving accurate even after changing the type of queries and/or documents used in the evaluated RAG systems.

This limitation stems from their reliance on vast pretraining datasets, making them susceptible to errors in unseen scenarios. To tackle these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external, relevant documents into the response generation process, thus leveraging non-parametric knowledge alongside LLMs' in-context learning abilities. However, existing RAG implementations primarily focus on initial input for context retrieval, overlooking the nuances of ambiguous or complex queries that necessitate further clarification or decomposition for accurate responses. To this end, we propose learning to Refine Query for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RQ-RAG) in this paper, endeavoring to enhance the model by equipping it with capabilities for explicit rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation. Our experimental results indicate that our method, when applied to a 7B Llama2 model, surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by an average of 1.9\% across three single-hop QA datasets, and also demonstrates enhanced performance in handling complex, multi-hop QA datasets.

| **[Dialectical Alignment: Resolving the Tension of 3H and Security Threats of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00486v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), ensuring they embody the principles of being helpful, honest, and harmless (3H), known as Human Alignment, becomes crucial. While existing alignment methods like RLHF, DPO, etc., effectively fine-tune LLMs to match preferences in the preference dataset, they often lead LLMs to highly receptive human input and external evidence, even when this information is poisoned. This leads to a tendency for LLMs to be Adaptive Chameleons when external evidence conflicts with their parametric memory. This exacerbates the risk of LLM being attacked by external poisoned data, which poses a significant security risk to LLM system applications such as Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address the challenge, we propose a novel framework: Dialectical Alignment (DA), which (1) utilizes AI feedback to identify optimal strategies for LLMs to navigate inter-context conflicts and context-memory conflicts with different external evidence in context window (i.e., different ratios of poisoned factual contexts); (2) constructs the SFT dataset as well as the preference dataset based on the AI feedback and strategies above; (3) uses the above datasets for LLM alignment to defense poisoned context attack while preserving the effectiveness of in-context knowledge editing. Our experiments show that the dialectical alignment model improves poisoned data attack defense by 20 and does not require any additional prompt engineering or prior declaration of ``you may be attacked`` to the LLMs' context window.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs provide summarization capabilities, their performance in complex, real-world scenarios remains under-explored. Our first contribution is LogicSumm, an innovative evaluation framework incorporating realistic scenarios to assess LLM robustness during RAG-based summarization. Based on limitations identified by LogiSumm, we then developed SummRAG, a comprehensive system to create training dialogues and fine-tune a model to enhance robustness within LogicSumm's scenarios. SummRAG is an example of our goal of defining structured methods to test the capabilities of an LLM, rather than addressing issues in a one-off fashion. Experimental results confirm the power of SummRAG, showcasing improved logical coherence and summarization quality.

However, classification-based approaches are limited by the cell size and cannot yield precise predictions, while retrieval-based systems usually suffer from poor search quality and inadequate coverage of the global landscape at varied scale and aggregation levels. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Img2Loc, a novel system that redefines image geolocalization as a text generation task. This is achieved using cutting-edge large multi-modality models like GPT4V or LLaVA with retrieval augmented generation. Img2Loc first employs CLIP-based representations to generate an image-based coordinate query database. It then uniquely combines query results with images itself, forming elaborate prompts customized for LMMs. When tested on benchmark datasets such as Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k, Img2Loc not only surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art models but does so without any model training.</p></details> |  |

However, the former depends on external resources, and both require incorporating the explicit documents into the context, which results in longer contexts that lead to more resource consumption. Recent works indicate that LLMs have modeled rich knowledge, albeit not effectively triggered or activated. Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented framework, Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG), which simulates the human capacity to compensate for knowledge deficits while answering questions solely through imagination, without relying on external resources. Guided by IAG, we propose an imagine richer context method for question answering (IMcQA), which obtains richer context through the following two modules: explicit imagination by generating a short dummy document with long context compress and implicit imagination with HyperNetwork for generating adapter weights. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that IMcQA exhibits significant advantages in both open-domain and closed-book settings, as well as in both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution generalizations.

Due to the limitation in the semantic understanding of retrieval models, the success of RAG heavily lies on the ability of LLMs to identify passages with utility. Recent efforts have explored the ability of LLMs to assess the relevance of passages in retrieval, but there has been limited work on evaluating the utility of passages in supporting question answering. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study about the capabilities of LLMs in utility evaluation for open-domain QA. Specifically, we introduce a benchmarking procedure and collection of candidate passages with different characteristics, facilitating a series of experiments with five representative LLMs. Our experiments reveal that: (i) well-instructed LLMs can distinguish between relevance and utility, and that LLMs are highly receptive to newly generated counterfactual passages. Moreover, (ii) we scrutinize key factors that affect utility judgments in the instruction design. And finally, (iii) to verify the efficacy of utility judgments in practical retrieval augmentation applications, we delve into LLMs' QA capabilities using the evidence judged with utility and direct dense retrieval results. (iv) We propose a k-sampling, listwise approach to reduce the dependency of LLMs on the sequence of input passages, thereby facilitating subsequent answer generation. We believe that the way we formalize and study the problem along with our findings contributes to a critical assessment of retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our code and benchmark can be found at \url{https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/utility_judgments}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted by SIGIR2024</p></details> |

These metrics are frequently hidden away in tables and/or their nested hyperlinks. To address this challenge, the approach of Table Question Answering (QA) has been developed to extract the relevant information. However, traditional Table QA training tasks that provide a table and an answer(s) from a gold cell coordinate(s) for a question may not always ensure extracting the accurate answer(s). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from tabular data using prompts. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-hop Few-shot Open Rich Table QA (MFORT-QA) approach, which consists of two major steps. The first step involves Few-Shot Learning (FSL), where relevant tables and associated contexts of hyperlinks are retrieved based on a given question. The retrieved content is then used to construct few-shot prompts as inputs to an LLM, such as ChatGPT. To tackle the challenge of answering complex questions, the second step leverages Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to decompose the complex question into a sequential chain of questions and reasoning thoughts in a multi-hop manner. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances this process by retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to the resulting reasoning thoughts and questions. These additional contexts are then used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more accurate answers from an LLM. Empirical results from OTT-QA demonstrate that our abstractive QA approach significantly improves the accuracy of extractive Table QA methods.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[FACTOID: FACtual enTailment fOr hallucInation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19113v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated numerous benefits. However, hallucination is a significant concern. In response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual information. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to retrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not put troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe Biden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion that is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called ``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that contradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation Detection), a benchmark dataset for FE. We propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings such as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. The proposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg. 40\% improvement in accuracy on the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods. As FE automatically detects hallucinations, we assessed 15 modern LLMs and ranked them using our proposed Auto Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI_auto). This index quantifies and offers a comparative scale to evaluate and rank LLMs according to their hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPR: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Copyright Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18920v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a flexible and robust technique to adapt models to private users data without training, to handle credit attribution, and to allow efficient machine unlearning at scale. However, RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular, it does so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user) distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two algorithms for copyright protection, CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods, our methods enable efficient copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular, we empirically show that applying CPR on top of unCLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark), while enabling credit attribution, copy-right protection, and deterministic, constant time, unlearning.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[InferDPT: Privacy-Preserving Inference for Black-box Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12214v6)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have greatly simplified text generation tasks. However, they have also raised concerns about privacy risks such as data leakage and unauthorized data collection. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving inference face practical challenges related to computation time and communication costs. In this paper, we propose InferDPT, the first practical framework for the privacy-preserving Inference of black-box LLMs, implementing Differential Privacy in Text generation. InferDPT comprises two key modules: the "perturbation module" utilizes the exponential mechanism to generate a perturbed prompt, facilitating privacy-preserving inference with black-box LLMs, and the "extraction module", inspired by knowledge distillation and retrieval-augmented generation, extracts coherent and consistent text from the perturbed generation result, ensuring successful text generation completion. To address privacy concerns related to previous exponential mechanisms' susceptibility to embedding revision attacks, we introduce RANTEXT, a novel differential privacy mechanism integrated into the perturbation module of InferDPT, which introduces the concept of "RANdom adjacency" for TEXT perturbation within the prompt. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that the text generation quality of InferDPT is comparable to that of non-private GPT-4, and RANTEXT surpasses existing state-of-the-art mechanisms, namely, SANTEXT+ and CUSTEXT+ in the trade-off between privacy and utility. Even with an privacy parameter epsilon value of 6.0, RANTEXT achieves an average privacy protection rate exceeding 90% against embedding revision attacks, which is 0.58 times higher than that of SANTEXT+ and 3.35 times higher than that of CUSTEXT+.</p></details> |  |

RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark.

However, evaluating semantic similarity and conducting searches for a specific query across various documents continue to be a complicated task. This complexity is due to the multifaceted nature of the task, the lack of standard benchmarks, whereas these challenges are further amplified for Arabic language. This paper endeavors to establish a straightforward yet potent benchmark for semantic search in Arabic. Moreover, to precisely evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics and the dataset, we conduct our assessment of semantic search within the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG).</p></details> |  |

Most previous work focuses on using RAG for single-round question answering, while how to adapt RAG to the complex conversational setting wherein the question is interdependent on the preceding context is not well studied. In this paper, we propose a conversation-level RAG approach, which incorporates fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-check for conversational question answering (CQA). In particular, our approach consists of three components, namely conversational question refiner, fine-grained retriever and self-check based response generator, which work collaboratively for question understanding and relevant information acquisition in conversational settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we also release a Chinese CQA dataset with new features including reformulated question, extracted keyword, retrieved paragraphs and their helpfulness, which facilitates further researches in RAG enhanced CQA.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers.

We construct a "semantic node" data structure to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process "semantic node" and generate AAS instance models from textual technical data. Our evaluation demonstrates a 62-79% effective generation rate, indicating a substantial proportion of manual creation effort can be converted into easier validation effort, thereby reducing the time and cost in creating AAS instance models. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability in automating AAS instance creation, enhancing semantic interoperability, and contributing to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications.

As per the Joint Practical Guide of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, terms used in legal documents shall be consistent, and identical concepts shall be expressed without departing from their meaning in ordinary, legal, or technical language. Thus, while drafting a new legislative document, having a framework that provides insights about existing definitions and helps define new terms based on a document's context will support such harmonized legal definitions across different regulations and thus avoid ambiguities. In this paper, we present LexDrafter, a framework that assists in drafting Definitions articles for legislative documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and existing term definitions present in different legislative documents. For this, definition elements are built by extracting definitions from existing documents. Using definition elements and RAG, a Definitions article can be suggested on demand for a legislative document that is being drafted. We demonstrate and evaluate the functionality of LexDrafter using a collection of EU documents from the energy domain.

The challenge is to imbibe the LLMs with domain specific knowledge using the most optimial resource and cost and in the best possible time. Many enterprises rely on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) which does not need LLMs to be ine-tuned but they are limited by the quality of vector databases and their retrieval capabilities rather than the intrinsic capabilities of the LLMs themselves. In our current work we focus on fine tuning LLaMA, an open source LLM using proprietary documents and code from an enterprise repository and use the fine tuned models to evaluate the quality of responses. As part of this work, we aim to guide beginners on how to start with fine tuning an LLM for documentation and code by making educated guesses on size of GPU required and options that are available for formatting the data. We also propose pre processing recipes for both documentation and code to prepare dataset in different formats. The proposed methods of data preparation for document datasets are forming paragraph chunks, forming question and answer pairs and forming keyword and paragraph chunk pairs. For code dataset we propose forming summary and function pairs. Further, we qualitatively evaluate the results of the models for domain specific queries. Finally, we also propose practical guidelines and recommendations for fine tuning LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

According to our method, the domain LLM achieved a 71.69\% accuracy in question answering tasks. Subsequently, we broadened our assessment to a novel dataset we developed in the economics and management field, where our method realized a 75\% accuracy. These outcomes underline the efficacy and adaptability of our approach for PCRA-LLM across various domains.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Improving Retrieval for RAG based Question Answering Models on Financial Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07221v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate responses relies heavily on the quality of input provided, particularly when employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG enhances LLMs by sourcing the most relevant text chunk(s) to base queries upon. Despite the significant advancements in LLMs' response quality in recent years, users may still encounter inaccuracies or irrelevant answers; these issues often stem from suboptimal text chunk retrieval by RAG rather than the inherent capabilities of LLMs. To augment the efficacy of LLMs, it is crucial to refine the RAG process. This paper explores the existing constraints of RAG pipelines and introduces methodologies for enhancing text retrieval. It delves into strategies such as sophisticated chunking techniques, query expansion, the incorporation of metadata annotations, the application of re-ranking algorithms, and the fine-tuning of embedding algorithms. Implementing these approaches can substantially improve the retrieval quality, thereby elevating the overall performance and reliability of LLMs in processing and responding to queries.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up, with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the 'Blended RAG' method of leveraging semantic search techniques, such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieves better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a 'Blended Retriever' to the RAG system to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q\&A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print version of paper submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14374v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG. Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer. FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets: TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA, respectively. Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on average across the three datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Quality Matters in Training Fusion-in-Decoder for Extractive Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14197v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation models augment knowledge encoded in a language model by providing additional relevant external knowledge (context) during generation. Although it has been shown that the quantity and quality of context impact the performance of retrieval-augmented generation models during inference, limited research explores how these characteristics affect model training. This paper explores how context quantity and quality during model training affect the performance of Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD), the state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation model, in extractive open-domain question answering tasks. Experimental results suggest that FiD models overfit to context quality during training and show suboptimal performance when evaluated on different context quality. Through the experimental results, we also reveal FiD models trained with different context quality have different cross-attention distribution patterns. Specifically, as context quality during training increases, FiD models tend to attend more uniformly to each passage in context. Finally, based on these observations, we propose a method to mitigate overfitting to specific context quality by introducing bias to the cross-attention distribution, which we demonstrate to be effective in improving the performance of FiD models on different context quality.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2023 |

However, there are conspicuous challenges such as vast data volumes and inconsistent symptom characterization standards, preventing full integration of healthcare AI systems with individual patients' needs. To promote professional and personalized healthcare, we propose an innovative framework, Heath-LLM, which combines large-scale feature extraction and medical knowledge trade-off scoring. Compared to traditional health management applications, our system has three main advantages: (1) It integrates health reports and medical knowledge into a large model to ask relevant questions to large language model for disease prediction; (2) It leverages a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mechanism to enhance feature extraction; (3) It incorporates a semi-automated feature updating framework that can merge and delete features to improve accuracy of disease prediction. We experiment on a large number of health reports to assess the effectiveness of Health-LLM system. The results indicate that the proposed system surpasses the existing ones and has the potential to significantly advance disease prediction and personalized health management.

Current open-source libraries support full-model inference and fine-tuning across multiple GPUs but fall short of accommodating the efficient parameter distribution required for retrieved context. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel framework for PEFT-compatible fine-tuning of Llama-2 models, leveraging distributed training. Our framework uniquely utilizes JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor-sharding for efficient resource management, thereby enabling accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for complex RAG applications, even on systems with limited GPU resources. Our experiments show more than 12x improvement in runtime compared to Hugging Face/DeepSpeed implementation with four GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we tested an unmodified version of GPT 3.5, a fine-tuned version, and the same unmodified model when given access to a vectorised RAG database, both in isolation and in combination with a basic, non-algorithmic soft prompt. In each case we tested the model's ability to answer a set of 100 questions relating primarily to events that occurred after September 2021 (the point at which GPT 3.5's training data set ends). We found that if commercial platforms are used and default settings are applied with no iteration in order to establish a baseline set of outputs, a fine-tuned model outperforms GPT 3.5 Turbo, while the RAG approach out-performed both. The application of a soft prompt significantly improved the performance of each approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected, using the correct term 'system prompting' instead of 'soft prompting'</p></details> |

Currently, machine learning and deep learning algorithms (ML&DL) have been widely applied for stock trend predictions, leading to significant progress. However, these methods fail to provide reasons for predictions, lacking interpretability and reasoning processes. Also, they can not integrate textual information such as financial news or reports. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have remarkable textual understanding and generation ability. But due to the scarcity of financial training datasets and limited integration with real-time knowledge, LLMs still suffer from hallucinations and are unable to keep up with the latest information. To tackle these challenges, we first release AlphaFin datasets, combining traditional research datasets, real-time financial data, and handwritten chain-of-thought (CoT) data. It has a positive impact on training LLMs for completing financial analysis. We then use AlphaFin datasets to benchmark a state-of-the-art method, called Stock-Chain, for effectively tackling the financial analysis task, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on financial analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING 2024.

Currently, this requires either separate models during inference, which increases computational cost, or destructive fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, we propose directly embedding information extraction capabilities into pre-trained language models using probing classifiers, enabling efficient simultaneous text generation and information extraction. For this, we introduce an approach called EMBER and show that it enables named entity recognition in decoder-only language models without fine-tuning them and while incurring minimal additional computational cost at inference time. Specifically, our experiments using GPT-2 show that EMBER maintains high token generation rates during streaming text generation, with only a negligible decrease in speed of around 1% compared to a 43.64% slowdown measured for a baseline using a separate NER model.

However, due to the complex syntax of HDLs and the limited availability of online resources, debugging HDL codes remains a difficult and time-intensive task, even for seasoned engineers. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop automated HDL code debugging models, which can alleviate the burden on hardware engineers. Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating, completing, and debugging software code, their utilization in the specialized field of HDL debugging has been limited and, to date, has not yielded satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-assisted HDL debugging framework, namely HDLdebugger, which consists of HDL debugging data generation via a reverse engineering approach, a search engine for retrieval-augmented generation, and a retrieval-augmented LLM fine-tuning approach. Through the integration of these components, HDLdebugger can automate and streamline HDL debugging for chip design.

Current research primarily centers on paragraph-level chunking. This approach treats all texts as equal and neglects the information contained in the structure of documents. We propose an expanded approach to chunk documents by moving beyond mere paragraph-level chunking to chunk primary by structural element components of documents. Dissecting documents into these constituent elements creates a new way to chunk documents that yields the best chunk size without tuning. We introduce a novel framework that evaluates how chunking based on element types annotated by document understanding models contributes to the overall context and accuracy of the information retrieved. We also demonstrate how this approach impacts RAG assisted Question & Answer task performance. Our research includes a comprehensive analysis of various element types, their role in effective information retrieval, and the impact they have on the quality of RAG outputs. Findings support that element type based chunking largely improve RAG results on financial reporting. Through this research, we are also able to answer how to uncover highly accurate RAG.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, it translates these queries into Feature Query Language (FQL), enabling efficient scanning and parsing of entire code repositories. In addition, S3LLM is equipped to handle diverse metadata types, including DOT, SQL, and customized formats. Furthermore, S3LLM incorporates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and LangChain technologies to directly query extensive documents. S3LLM demonstrates the potential of using locally deployed open-source LLMs for the rapid understanding of large-scale scientific computing software, eliminating the need for extensive coding expertise, and thereby making the process more efficient and effective.

Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid -- a decentralised Web specification -- to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address. Our prototype is open-source and available at: https://github.com/Vidminas/socialgenpod/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo paper accepted in Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Multi-modal Contrastive Learning with Expert Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10153v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce eCLIP, an enhanced version of the CLIP model that integrates expert annotations in the form of radiologist eye-gaze heatmaps. It tackles key challenges in contrastive multi-modal medical imaging analysis, notably data scarcity and the "modality gap" -- a significant disparity between image and text embeddings that diminishes the quality of representations and hampers cross-modal interoperability. eCLIP integrates a heatmap processor and leverages mixup augmentation to efficiently utilize the scarce expert annotations, thus boosting the model's learning effectiveness. eCLIP is designed to be generally applicable to any variant of CLIP without requiring any modifications of the core architecture. Through detailed evaluations across several tasks, including zero-shot inference, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) of radiology reports using a frozen Large Language Model, eCLIP showcases consistent improvements in embedding quality. The outcomes reveal enhanced alignment and uniformity, affirming eCLIP's capability to harness high-quality annotations for enriched multi-modal analysis in the medical imaging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at a conference</p></details> |
| **[DRAGIN: Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Real-time Information Needs of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10081v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm actively decides when and what to retrieve during the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs). There are two key elements of this paradigm: identifying the optimal moment to activate the retrieval module (deciding when to retrieve) and crafting the appropriate query once retrieval is triggered (determining what to retrieve). However, current dynamic RAG methods fall short in both aspects. Firstly, the strategies for deciding when to retrieve often rely on static rules. Moreover, the strategies for deciding what to retrieve typically limit themselves to the LLM's most recent sentence or the last few tokens, while the LLM's real-time information needs may span across the entire context. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new framework, DRAGIN, i.e., Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the real-time Information Needs of LLMs. Our framework is specifically designed to make decisions on when and what to retrieve based on the LLM's real-time information needs during the text generation process. We evaluate DRAGIN along with existing methods comprehensively over 4 knowledge-intensive generation datasets. Experimental results show that DRAGIN achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models in GitHub: https://github.com/oneal2000/DRAGIN/tree/main</p></details> |  |
| **[Repoformer: Selective Retrieval for Repository-Level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10059v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have initiated a new era in repository-level code completion. However, the invariable use of retrieval in existing methods exposes issues in both efficiency and robustness, with a large proportion of the retrieved contexts proving unhelpful or harmful to code language models (code LMs). To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes a selective RAG framework where retrieval is avoided when unnecessary. To power this framework, we design a self-supervised learning approach that enables a code LM to accurately self-evaluate whether retrieval can improve its output quality and robustly leverage the potentially noisy retrieved contexts. Using this LM as both the selective retrieval policy and the generation model, our framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting with an invariable retrieval approach on diverse benchmarks including RepoEval, CrossCodeEval, and a new benchmark. Meanwhile, our selective retrieval strategy results in strong efficiency improvements by as much as 70% inference speedup without harming the performance. We demonstrate that our framework effectively accommodates different generation models, retrievers, and programming languages. These advancements position our framework as an important step towards more accurate and efficient repository-level code completion.</p></details> |  |

Querying these databases to answer epidemiological questions is challenging due to the intricacy of medical terminology and the need for complex SQL queries. Here, we introduce an end-to-end methodology that combines text-to-SQL generation with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to answer epidemiological questions using EHR and claims data. We show that our approach, which integrates a medical coding step into the text-to-SQL process, significantly improves the performance over simple prompting. Our findings indicate that although current language models are not yet sufficiently accurate for unsupervised use, RAG offers a promising direction for improving their capabilities, as shown in a realistic industry setting.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[G-Retriever: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Textual Graph Understanding and Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07630v2)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph. While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs. In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and resists hallucination. (Our codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever.)</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGGED: Towards Informed Design of Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09040v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly benefits language models (LMs) by providing additional context for tasks such as document-based question answering (DBQA). Despite its potential, the power of RAG is highly dependent on its configuration, raising the question: What is the optimal RAG configuration? To answer this, we introduce the RAGGED framework to analyze and optimize RAG systems. On a set of representative DBQA tasks, we study two classic sparse and dense retrievers, and four top-performing LMs in encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures. Through RAGGED, we uncover that different models suit substantially varied RAG setups. While encoder-decoder models monotonically improve with more documents, we find decoder-only models can only effectively use < 5 documents, despite often having a longer context window. RAGGED offers further insights into LMs' context utilization habits, where we find that encoder-decoder models rely more on contexts and are thus more sensitive to retrieval quality, while decoder-only models tend to rely on knowledge memorized during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGged Edges: The Double-Edged Sword of Retrieval-Augmented Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01193v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate the remarkable progress of artificial intelligence. However, their tendency to hallucinate -- generate plausible but false information -- poses a significant challenge. This issue is critical, as seen in recent court cases where ChatGPT's use led to citations of non-existent legal rulings. This paper explores how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can counter hallucinations by integrating external knowledge with prompts. We empirically evaluate RAG against standard LLMs using prompts designed to induce hallucinations. Our results show that RAG increases accuracy in some cases, but can still be misled when prompts directly contradict the model's pre-trained understanding. These findings highlight the complex nature of hallucinations and the need for more robust solutions to ensure LLM reliability in real-world applications. We offer practical recommendations for RAG deployment and discuss implications for the development of more trustworthy LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Hallucination and Coverage Errors in Retrieval Augmented Generation for Controversial Topics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08904v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore a strategy to handle controversial topics in LLM-based chatbots based on Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) principle: acknowledge the absence of a single true answer and surface multiple perspectives. We frame this as retrieval augmented generation, where perspectives are retrieved from a knowledge base and the LLM is tasked with generating a fluent and faithful response from the given perspectives. As a starting point, we use a deterministic retrieval system and then focus on common LLM failure modes that arise during this approach to text generation, namely hallucination and coverage errors. We propose and evaluate three methods to detect such errors based on (1) word-overlap, (2) salience, and (3) LLM-based classifiers. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based classifiers, even when trained only on synthetic errors, achieve high error detection performance, with ROC AUC scores of 95.3% for hallucination and 90.5% for coverage error detection on unambiguous error cases. We show that when no training data is available, our other methods still yield good results on hallucination (84.0%) and coverage error (85.2%) detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[From human experts to machines: An LLM supported approach to ontology and knowledge graph construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08345v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional process of building Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) heavily relies on human domain experts to define entities and relationship types, establish hierarchies, maintain relevance to the domain, fill the ABox (or populate with instances), and ensure data quality (including amongst others accuracy and completeness). On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity for their ability to understand and generate human-like natural language, offering promising ways to automate aspects of this process. This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by open-source LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts. We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications. To evaluate the answers generated via Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) as well as the KG concepts automatically extracted using LLMs, we design a judge LLM, which rates the generated content based on ground truth. Our findings suggest that employing LLMs could potentially reduce the human effort involved in the construction of KGs, although a human-in-the-loop approach is recommended to evaluate automatically generated KGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuning for the development of AI-driven knowledge-based systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09727v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of generative large language models (G-LLM) opened up new opportunities for the development of new types of knowledge-based systems similar to ChatGPT, Bing, or Gemini. Fine-tuning (FN) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are the techniques that can be used to implement domain adaptation for the development of G-LLM-based knowledge systems. In our study, using ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR scores, and cosine similarity, we compare and examine the performance of RAG and FN for the GPT-J-6B, OPT-6.7B, LlaMA, LlaMA-2 language models. Based on measurements shown on different datasets, we demonstrate that RAG-based constructions are more efficient than models produced with FN. We point out that connecting RAG and FN is not trivial, because connecting FN models with RAG can cause a decrease in performance. Furthermore, we outline a simple RAG-based architecture which, on average, outperforms the FN models by 16% in terms of the ROGUE score, 15% in the case of the BLEU score, and 53% based on the cosine similarity. This shows the significant advantage of RAG over FN in terms of hallucination, which is not offset by the fact that the average 8% better METEOR score of FN models indicates greater creativity compared to RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mafin: Enhancing Black-Box Embeddings with Model Augmented Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12177v4)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective solution for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). The retrieval stage in RAG typically involves a pre-trained embedding model, which converts queries and passages into vectors to capture their semantics. However, a standard pre-trained embedding model may exhibit sub-optimal performance when applied to specific domain knowledge, necessitating fine-tuning. This paper addresses scenarios where the embeddings are only available from a black-box model. We introduce Model augmented fine-tuning (Mafin) -- a novel approach for fine-tuning a black-box embedding model by augmenting it with a trainable embedding model. Our results demonstrate that Mafin significantly enhances the performance of the black-box embeddings by only requiring the training of a small augmented model. We validate the effectiveness of our method on both labeled and unlabeled datasets, illustrating its broad applicability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Development of a Reliable and Accessible Caregiving Language Model (CaLM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06857v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training. Because of this, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care. Large language models can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers as educational tools or as adjunct to care. This study aimed to develop a reliable Caregiving Language Model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and evaluate the performance of the model compared to a large FM. We developed CaLM using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. We used two small FMs as candidates for the FM of CaLM (LLaMA-2 and Falcon with 7B parameters) and larger FM GPT-3.5 as a benchmark. We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the Internet. In this study, we focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias. We evaluated the models' performance using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability to provide accurate references with the answers. The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the large FM performed better than small FMs across all metrics. The most interesting result is that small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA-2 small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers. The study shows that reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed by using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, updating this knowledge incurs high training costs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods address this issue by integrating external knowledge. The model can answer questions it couldn't previously by retrieving knowledge relevant to the query. This approach improves performance in certain scenarios for specific tasks. However, if irrelevant texts are retrieved, it may impair model performance. In this paper, we propose Retrieval Augmented Iterative Self-Feedback (RA-ISF), a framework that iteratively decomposes tasks and processes them in three submodules to enhance the model's problem-solving capabilities. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing benchmarks, performing well on models like GPT3.5, Llama2, significantly enhancing factual reasoning capabilities and reducing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.
